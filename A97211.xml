         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>

            <p>I Shall not tire thy patience with any tedious Prefatory Diſcourſe, only hint a Word or two concerning the occaſion of this Treatiſe, with the Method obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the compoſure of it; about a year and half ſince, or ſomething more, amidſt that <hi>African</hi> brood of Erroneous Books which the lawleſs liberty of the Preſs has Midwiv'd into the world, came forth a Treatiſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as, with a Timpany of vain glorious confidence for the <hi>Jews Saturday-Sabbath;</hi> ſo no leſs opprobious contempt of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> our <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath.</hi> The Author of it M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tho. Tillam by Name,</hi> by <hi>Profeſſion an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> was pleaſed in Print to found a challenge and provoke me to the combat in anſwering of it. It was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was fully reſolved what to do, the ſenſe of my own Inſufficiency beſpake my ſilence, and willed me rather to ſit ſtill in obſcurity, than venture abroad to the view of a captious and quarrelſom World: Beſides, my Paſtoral charge and Preaching-work would ſcarce afford me that leiſure which others of more natural promptneſs and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous parts and gifts might well enough ſpare for ſuch an Imployment: But on the other hand the ſpreading of this <hi>Jewiſh Leaven,</hi> together with the preſſing Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb facs="tcp:115959:4"/>of ſome Chriſtian Friends perſwaded me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this work, which accordingly I did, and after I had ſpent much time and written many ſheets in anſwering this Author Page by Page, I found his Method ſo confuſed, his excurſions ſo many, his eructations of putrid choler and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny ſo bitter, that I had not the patience to follow him any longer in that wildgooſe-chaſe, but laid all aſide, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon a new Method; namely, to aſſert the Truth <hi>theti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> in diſtinct Poſitions, and anſwer his moſt material Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as Objections againſt it. He would fain perſwade ſilly people, That <hi>Antichriſt changed the Sabbath,</hi> and goes about to prove it from <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. where we read of a <hi>little horn that thought to change Times and Laws;</hi> and with this little horn he makes a loud noiſe up and down his Book. But who told him that this horn was Antichriſt? Our beſt Expoſitors take it to be meant of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and indeed <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. cleerly proves it. But what deſperate inſolency is this, to take the crown of Chriſt and ſet it upon the head of Antichriſt? Is not the change of the Jewiſh Law attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.12. and did he not alſo change their times and ſeaſons of worſhip? was their weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath exempted? I pray where or how? not by the fourth Commandement, for we have proved that the ſeventh day from the Creation was never the ſubſtance of that precept; nor by any clauſe in the New Teſtament, for there it is rather repealed. 'Tis true, the Moral duty of reſt, remains ſtill in a holy day of weekly recourſe, according to the Commandment, but the old Sabbath being of a ſhadowy nature in the after obſervation (if not in the firſt Inſtitution) of it, is certainly done away by Chriſt the ſubſtance of all Legal ſhadows; yet not ſimply, but in way of exchange for a new day of the ſame number, though not of the ſame ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy nature.</p>
            <p>What I have argued for the change of the day is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently authorized by the Scriptures, the Fathers, and our own judicious Divines. My Arguments are but few in number; more might have been added but for oppreſſing
<pb facs="tcp:115959:4"/>the Reader's either purſe or patience. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> have largely handled, what I have but briefly touched. If what I have written be anſwered with ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gibes, and railing Rhetorick, as Mr. <hi>Jeniſons Book was,</hi> My next anſwer ſhall be nothing but ſilence and contempt; which I the rather hint, becauſe the Adverſary has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Reply before he read my Book; <hi>right or wrong,</hi> it ſeems he is reſolved to have the laſt word, for which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe never to contend. If I know my own heart, 'tis truth, not triumph that I ſeek and thirſt after; truth I ſay, grounded upon the Scriptures, ſealed with the blood of Martyrs, atteſted by the Primitive Fathers, and maintained by the pens of the moſt Reformed Writers; ſuch is the truth here aſſerted, and I ſhall own nothing as an Anſwer to it, but that which fully anſwers all theſe.</p>
            <p>Now my Chriſtian Friends and Brethren, I beſeech you love and live this truth; ſtand to it, ſtand for it, and ſtand in it as long as you live. Take heed of corrupt Books and broachers of error; you may be too credulous, too cautelous you cannot be. Let neither the pompous Phraſes, nor proud threats of men either allure you, or affright you from the truths of God. <hi>T. T.</hi> abounds in both theſe Artifices; charming ſome with his Rhetorick, ſcaring others with his Bulls and big words, as he does <hi>William Sloat</hi> by name, <hi>leaving him</hi> (as his Printed Book ſpeaks) <hi>under the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſin to the judgement of the great day:</hi> and yet this <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Sloat</hi> is known to be a man of ſober converſation, profeſſing Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; only he muſt be expunged out of the Catalogue of Chriſtians for not being able to keep the Jews Sabbath, and damned to the fiery furnace of Hell, becauſe he could no longer dance after this mans Pipe, or bow down to Images that he has ſet up in his fancy; <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I mean.</hi> To conclude, I beſeech you, Chriſtians for the Lords ſake, and your ſouls ſake hold faſt the <hi>Good Old</hi> Truths of Chriſt in this <hi>hour of Englands temptation,</hi> and cleave to that <hi>Good Old Cauſe the (Chriſtian Sabbath)</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:115959:5"/>the rigid Prelatical party ſought to ſubvert by the Book of Sports, and many pernicious Pamphlets and practiſes, till the wrath of God brake out upon the land in thoſe late bloody ſhowers, the Remembrance whereof methinks ſhould daunt the heart of the moſt <hi>Goliah</hi>-like Adverſary, that ſhall dare to draw the ſword of defiance the ſecond time againſt this <hi>Chriſtian Cauſe:</hi> If any will be ſo fool-hardy as ſtill to fight againſt God and the Lamb, in profaning, and teaching others to profane his day, by working, as formerly ſome did by ſporting; yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted all you that fear God and love the Lord Jeſus to keep holy the Lords day, making it no otherwiſe a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-day, then <hi>by working out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> which is the humble and hearty advice of</p>

                  </note> Mr. <hi>Tillam,</hi> with ſome others, is confident that it was inſtituted before the fall of man, and founded upon mount <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> not a little abuſing that Scripture to prove it, Pſal 87.1. <hi>Gods foundations are in the holy mountaint.</hi> Belike he would inſinuate, with <hi>Toſtatus</hi> and ſome other Popiſh Authors, that Paradiſe was ſome mountainous place (a fancy purpoſely deviſed by them to ſhelter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> from the floud:) But this is to build caſtles in the aire; ſuch notions may paſs for glorious truths among Vulgar heads, when judicious pens have branded them as Popiſh Legends. For the opinion it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sabbath was firſt inſtituted in Paradiſe before the fall of man, we ſhall in due time diſcover the weakneſs of it, and give ſatisfying anſwers to all the ſeeming argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought to ſupport it. But firſt I ſhall propoſe, and endeavour to prove a Counter poſition, namely, that it ſeems more conſonant to Scripture, to affirm, that the Sabbath was inſtituted (though in the beginning) yet after the fall, in mans corrupt and vitiated eſtate. The probation whereof depends much (though not altogether) upon the deciſion of that often canvaſſed queſtion, Whether our firſt Parents ſinned the ſame day on which they were created? I ſhall not be ſo peremptory as to paſs a damnatory ſentence upon thoſe that are for the negative; yet after ſome ſtudy and inquiry into Scriptures and Authors about it, I am inclined to undertake the affirmative, namely, That our firſt Parents were created and corrupted,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. &amp; 2 ch. compared with chap. 3.1.</note> made and marrd, alive and dead in one and the ſame ſame day; which ſeems very probable by this, that as ſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſpoken of their creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without mention of any other thing conſiderable, he paſſes to their defection. This is no ſingular notion, but the generally received opinion of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times.<note place="margin">

'Tis a concluſion found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a fallacy, which the Logicians call a Fallacy of compoſition, when thoſe things are jumbled together which ought to be taken aſunder; for the detection whereof let it be conſidered, that in the text alledged, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. there be two diſtinct clauſes; firſt, Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his works, <hi>He ſaw every thing that he made, and behold it was very good.</hi> Secondly, the concluſion of the day; <hi>and the evening and the morning were the ſixth day.</hi> Now to take theſe two clauſes conjunctly, which are related diſtinctly, and to argue (as this Author does) that man had not ſinned on the ſixth day, for then all was very good, is a meer ſophiſme, ſuch as every pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Logick is able to reſolve; for why might not Gods approbation be given forth in the morning or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of the ſixth day, and time enough left before night

               <p>This is evident from principles of reaſon as well as from the forementioned places of Scripture; for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the production of ſomething out of nothing, or that which is as much as nothing. Now betwixt the being of ſomething and nothing there can be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtate, and conſequently no imaginable ſpace of time, but an imperceptible moment: Hence that receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed maxime, that Creation is in an inſtant. Now to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate this to the work of the ſixth day, conſiſting of man and beaſts; certainly the forming of theſe creatures being momentaneous in the ſenſe above mentioned, took up but little of the day. I can ſee no colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrary, but our firſt Parents might be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and the whole creation compleated in the fore part of the ſixth day. And doubtleſs, as ſoon as the creation was ended, the divine approbatiom was added; <hi>And God ſaw that it was good.</hi> For ſurely as ſoon as the creature was, the Creator ſaw what it was, and he ſaw it to be good, for he made it good. And although the concluſion of the day be preſently added, yet 'tis without diſpute, that many other things were tranſacted (though not expreſſed in the firſt Chapter) before the cloſe of the ſixth day: as the naming of the creatures, the joyning of our firſt parents together in marriage, and diſpoſing of them in the garden, yea the giving of the Law, and in all likelyhood the breaking of it too.

In the three firſt verſes you have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God's finiſhing the heavens and the earth, as alſo his reſting on the ſeventh day.

                  <hi>then</hi> Adam <hi>did obſerve, and was bound to obſerve the firſt Sabbath in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: But neither of theſe can be proved from Scripture: Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Adam</hi> did unqueſtionably obſerve the firſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in Paradiſe, cannot be demonſtratively proved from Scripture. This is undeniable, that whenever, or where-ever he kept his firſt Sabbath, he did it in imitation of God's example: Now how could he reſt a whole day by God's example, till God had fully completed the firſt ſeventh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115959:14"/>dayes reſt for his example?<note place="margin">Eph. 5.1.</note> Imitation of God being a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, not a concomitant act, a following of him as dear children, not a fellow-acting with him. I can therefore ſee no congruity in that paſſage of <hi>T.T.</hi> where he reaſons thus againſt reaſon;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 54.</note> 
                  <hi>Certainly if Adam were a follower of God as a dear child, he muſt needs keep the Sabbath with his Father.</hi> With his Father! how then could he follow him? Certainly God went before, if <hi>Adam</hi> followed him as a dear child. I cannot conceive how he could poſſibly keep a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath that God himſelf had not firſt bleſſed and ſanctified to that end. I may upon better grounds ſuppoſe (with a late renowned Champion in this controverſie) that God alone kept the firſt Sabbath (as Chriſt alone the firſt Lord's day) that he might afford <hi>Adam</hi> an example,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cawdrey's</hi> Sab. rediv. p. 3. cap. 1.</note> as of working ſix daies, by his being exerciſed ſix daies in the work of creation, ſo of reſting the ſeventh in it's next weekly return, and ſo ſucceſſively week after week. But it will be ſaid, if <hi>Adam</hi> were bound to keep the firſt Sabbath, we are bound to believe he did keep it: Therefore a word or two of that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he were bound, I demand, <hi>quo jure,</hi> by what Law? By the Law written in his heart? why then was he bound to keep a Sabbath before there was a Sabbath to keep? for the Law was graven in his heart on the ſixth day, as a branch of that<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4.24. Col. 3.10.</note> divine image of God concreated with him, Whereas the Sabbath (to be ſure) was not inſtituted till the ſeventh day, if then. Beſides, the Law written in the table of <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart was the ſame (in this Authors judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which was afterwards written in Tables of Stone, that is, the fourth Commandement: which (if we take his and Mr. <hi>Brabournes</hi> Comment upon it) preſcribes ſix daies for labour before a ſeventh of reſt. Now this order <hi>Adam</hi> could not poſſibly obſerve for the firſt week, being created but on the ſixth day. He muſt therefore look out ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law, and where he will find it I cannot ſee, unleſs in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. and he muſt be very ſharp-ſighted to find any thing there that looks like a Law binding our firſt Parents
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115959:14"/>to obſerve the firſt Sabbath. For let the words be well pondered, <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it,</hi>

                  <hi>becaſe in it he had reſted from all his works which he had created and made.</hi> Whence we may clearly gather,<note place="margin">'Tis not ſaid becauſe he ſhould reſt, but had reſted.</note> that God's reſting on the ſeventh day was in order of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bleſſing and ſanctifying of the day: as thoſe words <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>On the ſeventh day God reſted from all his works which he had made,</hi>

So in the 2. Chap. he makes the bleſſing to follow upon Gods reſting, as before upon his working.</note> but evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long enough to diſcharge our firſt parents by virtue of thoſe words from any obligation to keep the firſt Sabbath. And whereas <hi>T.T.</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that the Sabbath was made for man, and if <hi>Adam</hi> were a man, the Sabbath was made for him; I grant the whole argument, onely with this diſtinction, That although it was made for man, yet it follows not that it was made for man as ſoon as man was made. Neither has he alledged any one text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>(Valeat quantum valere poteſt)</hi> of ſufficient evidence to ſupport his grand concluſion, <hi>That the ſeventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was inſtituted and obſerved in pure Paradiſe.</hi> Which if it<note n="b" place="margin">Yet I grant it not.</note> ſhould be granted him, yet his feeble cauſe would receive no invincible ſtrength by it. For although it would prove a Sabbath, and a weekly Sabbath, one day in ſeven to be moral and perpetual (which I deny not) (and herein I could joyn iſſue with the contrary-minded) yet what is this to the perpetuity and immutability of that old ſeventh day? ſince in the judgment of all Interpreters, both antient and modern (except Jews) onely one day in ſeven, or a ſeventh part of weekly time is here perpetually eſtabliſhed, that old ſeventh day onely temporarily, and during the ſtate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115959:15"/>of the old world. So <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> Here (ſaies he,) from the beginning God has intimated to us this doctrine,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Chryſoſt. Hom. 19. in Gen. 2.</note> inſtructing us to ſet apart one day in the circle of every week for ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. Note by the way, he ſaies not it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly determined here, (that is, left for the fourth Commandement) but it is intimated and implied here. And the like ſaies <hi>Junius.</hi> But to draw to a concluſion; I ſuppoſe it is more then probably demonſtrative (If I may ſo ſpeak without a Soloeciſm) that the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was inſtituted (though in the beginning) yet after the Fall, in man's corrupt eſtate, when he had put off his publick capacity as the repreſentative of mankind, and was looked upon as a ſingle perſon, yea a ſinful perſon, and one that ſtood in need of a Redeemer; and ſo the day muſt needs be alterable, as ſhall be ſhortly argued and evinced. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if we ſhould ſuppoſe the date of the Sabbaths inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be utterly uncertain, as the inſtitution of Sacrifices is, I ſee not but this may argue (as to the day) mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtamped upon it. It is true, the ſolemne worſhip of God is unalterable, as long as there is a God to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; but the old way of worſhip by Sacrifices was mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table from the very firſt original of it. Thus I grant the time of worſhip,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1. <hi>Chryſ. in</hi> Hebr. Hom. 11. Baſil. in Iſai. c. 20.</note> the Sabbath it ſelf, being an inſeparable adjunct of ſolemne worſhip, is perpetual; but the old day, the ſeventh from the Creation; was made mutable in the firſt inſtitution of it. Indeed in ſome ſenſe we have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſtill, ſpiritual ſacrifices; and we have a Sabbath ſtill, yea<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 24.20.</note> a literal Sabbath: But old Sabbaths and old Sacrifices being twins, (though both honorable, and ſerviceable in their generations) yet like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins they lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and died together, and let both together in God's name be buried in the grave of Chriſt, ſo as never to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15, 17.</note> But let our Goſpel-worſhip and Goſpel-Sabbath take life from our Saviour's Reſurrection, which brought with it a new Creation, a new World, making all things new, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115959:15"/>
               <p n="2">2. That the old ſeventh day was made alterable in the firſt inſtitution, will further appear, if we conſider the Law or command by which it was inſtituted; which is no where to be found but in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. As for the Law written in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s breaſt, it is too dark to ground an inſtitution upon. We muſt have a Law written in God's book. And there is no other that I know of but <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. which if I grant the Adverſary to be a command (for ſome do ſtiffly deny it) yet I muſt be bold to tell him, it is but a conſequential command: For although it be ſaid, <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it;</hi> yet it is not ſaid, Let man ſanctifie it. Here is included God's example, but no expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And if the New Teſtament do not afford us as much warrant for the Lord's day as this amounts to, I will yield the Cauſe. But of that hereafter. Let the Reader one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take notice (by the way) how mortally <hi>T. T.</hi> hath wounded his own cauſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pa.</hi> 36.</note> by exclaiming ſo bitterly againſt Conſequences. He calls it Philoſophie, and the deceit of men to eſtabliſh Ordinances by Conſequences. Why let me ask him, Was the Patriarchal Sabbath for above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years together an Ordinance of God? for my part I never doubted of it. But he can never make it good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Conſequence, he muſt make a new Bible firſt; for expreſs command there is none, onely God's example, which without a precept is not alwayes binding. And ſo (to uſe his own words) the Lord hath diſappointed the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the crafty, and ſnared him in his own wiſdom, he dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a pit for the Lord's day, and his Saturdays Sabbath is fallen into it, help it out how he can. For his life he can find no more in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. then an implicit command for that old ſeventh day. And now the next queſtion will be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a temporary, or a perpetual precept? If perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it muſt be moral. But that it cannot be by his own rule; for he has fairly granted, That a Moral Law is not meerly good becauſe commanded, but therefore commanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good: underſtand it of a Moral natural Law. Now I beſeech you, Sir, what natural goodneſs was there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115959:16"/>in the ſeventh day more then in the ſixth or fifth? Is one day in it ſelf any better then another as to God? And as to man, if any day had been naturally or morally good above the reſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.28. Pſal. 8.56.</note> in all reaſon it had been the ſixth day, on which God made man, crowned him with his bleſſings, and gave him dominion over his creatures; or the firſt day, in which he made the heavens, the Angels, and the elements.

This were to condemn the generation of Gods Children, and Canonize your ſelf, with your few miſled aſſociates, for the only Saints in Chriſtendome; which I would hope you dare not do, though I know you dare as much as another.</p>
               <p>Well, the adverſary is brought to this Dilemma; Either God has no people in the world but ſuch as are of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, or his moral and immutable Laws are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts, or the Saturday-Sabbath is none of thoſe Lawes. The laſt is the likelieſt in the judgment of any indifferent Reader; let his cauſe be tryed where he pleaſes, either at Natures tribunal, or the throne of Grace in the hearts of believers, and he will be caſt at both. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is both blind and dumb in the buſineſs; and if he plead the law of Grace (which is rectifyed and refined na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) the whole Chriſtian world will give in evidence againſt him. A Sabbath, a day of holy reſt, indeed it will own, and one day of ſeven in proportion; but the particularity of the day, the ſeventh from the Creation, it utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims. And where he will find advocates for it, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among the unbelieving Jews, or a few misbelieving Chriſtians Judaizing, I know not. Therefore ſurely it is no ingredient of Gods moral and immutable Lawes. The concluſion then is, that it was but a temporary precept by which it was eſtabliſhed, which ſome call ceremonial, others had rather term it poſitive, but none perpetual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch as are more apt to ſay anything then able to prove it when then have ſaid it. We deny not the fourth

               <p>And this may ſerve as a proper Engine to undermine that grand argument founded on the inſtitution of marriage. <hi>P.</hi> 155. <hi>The Sabbath is a precept</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as ancient, as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal as marriage, both were inſtituted in paradiſe for</hi> Adam <hi>and all his poſterity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We grant that the inſtitution of marriage was made in pure paradiſe, which ever ſince has made it hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongſt all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. And thus far we alſo grant the firſt inſtitution is a perpetual obligation, <hi>viz.</hi> That one man is bound to one woman; yet I hope no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115959:17"/>man is tyed by that firſt inſtitution to make choice of this or that particular woman; but he is at liberty to marry whom he liſts (provided it be in the Lord;) ſo alſo admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sabbath to be inſtituted in paradiſe; yet I can ſee no reaſon why it ſhould limit us to that particular day, but (that notwithſtanding) we may obſerve any other day that ſhall appear to be of the Lords appointment, as the firſt day of the week infallibly is, and therefore it bears the Lords name, being ſtyled the <hi>Lords Day</hi> by way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency. Indeed now the day is fixed, and we cannot chuſe another, nor change it to another,<note place="margin">Pſa 118.29. Rev. 1.10.</note> for reaſons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be rendered. But enough is ſaid to prove the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (whatever it was, whereby the old Sabbath was inſtituted) to be but temporary, though it had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Innocency. A poſitive precept given in innocency might ſuffer much alteration by mans apoſtaſie:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sheph.</hi> Theſ. 17.19.</note> For (to borrow the words of a reverend Author) the ſin of man made the Lord repent that ever he had made man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that ever he made the world for man; which might be a ſufficient ground of the Law-givers pleaſure to alter and change the day ſtated upon the worlds Creation, to another day ſtated upon the worlds Redemption, of which the Lord will never repent. Now if a precept or inſtitution given before the fall might be mutable at the Law givers pleaſure, how much more this of the ſeventh day which was rather impoſed ſince the fall, as the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacrifices, the prohibition of blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. That the old ſeventh day was made alterable in the firſt inſtitution of the Sabbath, is moſt of all evident from the ground or occaſion upon which it was inſtituted; and this is hinted unto us in thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2.<note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſworth</hi> annot. in Gen. 2.2</note>

                  <note place="margin">So judicious Mr. <hi>White</hi> in Gen. 2.</note> and why may not this be the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, That on the ſeventh day God was pleaſed by a ſignal hand of Providence to perfect his works of Creations, either by eſtabliſhing them to continue as they do this day, or at leaſt by manifeſting their accompliſhment in his reſt and ceſſation from Creating-work? Take the word <hi>(Ended)</hi> in this ſenſe, and ſo it informs us, that the ground of Gods ſanctifying the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, was not ſimply his reſt upon that day but alſo the reaſon of that reſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. v. 3.4.</note> namely the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of his works, witneſſed by his reſting, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the Hebrews plainly intimates. And not only that, but alſo the reſult and conſequent of both, namely the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying and honouring of that day above all other dayes for the time being, by crowning it with the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt work then made, or manifeſted to be made perfect.<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.3.</note> Hence the ſeventh day was ſtyled, <hi>The Honorable of the Lord;</hi> not that in it ſelf one day is more honorable and obſervable then another, but that which differences the one from the other, and dignifies one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, is Gods caſting honour upon it by ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable work of Providence, either begun or finiſhed upon that day. Upon which account moſt of the Jewes Feſtivals were inſtituted; as their Paſſeover in the 14th of <hi>Abib;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 23.5. Eſth. 9.21.</note> the Feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> on the 14th of <hi>Adar;</hi> like our Gunpowder-treaſon-day, on the 5. of November: becauſe the noble acts of God have been done upon theſe dayes. And this was a main ground of their weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath upon the ſeventh day; being a day crowned with the greateſt work then viſible, a work manifeſted to be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115959:18"/>on the ſeventh day, by Gods reſting on that day. Yet this muſt be noted, that the finiſhing of Gods work did not make the day more honorable then others by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſity, but only by poſitive right and equity. There was no neceſſary and natural cauſe why the ſeventh day, on which the work was declaratively ended, ſhould be more honorable then the ſixth day, on which it was really ended and finiſhed, only it was Gods will and pleaſure to have it ſo. Having premiſed this by the way; now let us ſee how the old Sabbath was founded upon the finiſhing of his works: As thus; That day which God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and crowned with the accompliſhment of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt work, muſt be the day of ſolemn worſhip or Sabbath-day: But the ſeventh day from the Creation was thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and crowned in the Cradle or infancy of the world: Therefore that day muſt be the Sabbath day, <hi>viz.</hi> till a greater work take place. And then the argument will conclude as ſtrongly for the change of the day, as ever it did for the choice of it.</p>
               <p>For we ſhall argue thus; If the ground of ſtating the Sabbath on the ſeventh day were applicable to another day, then the Sabbath in the firſt ground-work of it was altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to another day: But the ground of ſtating it upon that old ſeventh day was applicable to another day, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The conſequence is cleere as the Sun; for as it is with duties, ſo with dayes of worſhip; the grounds upon which they are ſetled being applicable to other times and places, the dayes and duties themſelves have alwayes been movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and circumſtantially mutable alſo; as that duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing of Gods Sanctuary (which is mated and coupled with keeping his Sabbaths) the ground of it being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Temple as well as the Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Levit. 19.30.</note> the duty it ſelf was alſo moveable from the Tabernacle to the Temple, although the firſt were only in being when the precept was given. And the like muſt be ſaid of the Sabbath: The conſequence hath evidence enough in it ſelf to every vulgar eye. If the foundation be moveable, ſo is the building.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115959:19"/>If the Aſſumption be queſtioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ground of fixing the Sabbath on the ſeventh day was moveable and applicable to another day, we ſhall thus confirm it; The ground of fixing the Sabbath on the old ſeventh day was Gods honouring and advancing that day above all other dayes (for the time being) by his moſt eminent work of Creation, manifeſted to be accompliſhed on that day; therefore when another day ſhall be crowned with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of a more eminent Creation, the ſame ground and reaſon which caſt the Sabbath on the old day will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably carry it to the new. Now the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a new Creation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and it was long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go propheſied, that as the<note n="a" place="margin">Hag. 2.9.</note> glory of the ſecond Temple ſhould out ſhine that of the firſt, ſo the glory of this new Creation ſhould excell that of the old, and comparatively eate out the memory of it.<note n="b" place="margin">Iſai. 65.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, ſayes the Lord, and the old ſhall not be remembered nor come into mind.</hi> Not that the Lord would ſimply and abſolutely have the memory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be leſſened, but reſpectively and in compariſon of Redemption,; it muſt not be obliterated, but only ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated: retained and remembred it muſt be ſtill, but as a leſſer work then Redemption, and as a leſſer good to us, as the Law is to the Goſpel, or the Old Teſtament to the New. Redemption muſt be owned as the greater and better work, in as much as Spiritual things are better then Natural, and Gods laſt works are his beſt; the firſt being only preparative to the laſt, as Dr. <hi>Sibbs</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently obſerves.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115959:19"/>had created another world for me. Let the redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo; yea, the work is not only better to me, but greater in it ſelf too.

Here was a work ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wonder. Beſides, in the work of Creation there was nothing to with ſtand: But in the work of Redemption here was Juſtice againſt Mercy, wrath againſt pity. In a word, in the Creation God brought ſomething out of nothing, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption he hath out of one contrary brought another, good out of evil, life out of death. Is not thy ſoul raviſhed, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, at theſe diſcoveries of wiſdome, grace and power ſhining forth in thy ſouls Redemption? Canſt thou ſee the like in the worlds Creation?

                  </note> that is, to lift them up in dignity and preeminency above the reſt of the people. Thus he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the Lord would magnifie and exalt the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on day; and why? Becauſe on this day the moſt glorious work of redemption was to be accompliſhed, <hi>the ſtone which the builders reſuſed being made the head of the corner, i. e.</hi> to perfect and complete the fabrick of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus is the reſurrection-day prophetically crowned with honour above all other dayes, Old Sabbath and all: For the work crowns the day, and the greater the work the greater the day. And therefore although the laſt day of the week were the greateſt in dignity during the ſupereminency of the old Creation, yet when a greater work was to be finiſhed, the day on which it was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude muſt without diſpute be the greater day. As <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> being the laſt and greateſt of the prophets, yet was leſſe then the leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven; ſo I may ſay of the Old Sabbath, the greateſt day under the Old Teſtament, yet it muſt vail and ſtoop when the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhines forth in a new day under the New Teſtament. Surely the ſecond Creation muſt have a Sabbath of comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration as well as the firſt, or elſe God ſhould magnifie his leſſer work of Creation above his greater work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And thus I ſuppoſe I have made good my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition both Logically and Theologically, that the old ſeventh day was alterable in its firſt inſtitution, ſince the ſame ground of ſtating the Sabbath at firſt upon that day might be a ſufficient ground of tranſlating it to another day, as now it is; and that by Divine Authority, as ſhall be ſeen hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>engageth us to that day ſtill.</hi> And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115959:20"/>again; <hi>The world being created not only for Iſrael but for all people, I appeal to all conſcientious Chriſtians, whether all mankind be not bound to that very day who enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Creation.</hi> (By the way let me tell him, when I read his inſulting challenge, I expected Scripture-argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not popular appeals.) But to let him ſwim in his own element, the ſum of his appealing (for arguing I cannot call it) amounts but to this, that if the old ſeventh day were ſet apart in memory of the Creation, which every Chriſtian (as a creature) is bound to commemorate, then the day is unchangeable, &amp; perpetually to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>But to this I anſwer; The conſequence is ſick and craſie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> and therefore it can produce but a weak concluſion. For firſt, the Covenant of grace (I ſuppoſe) is as ancient as the old Sabbath, I am ſure as eminent a mercy as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Sabbath: And doubtleſs to every true-hearted Chriſtian the memory of Gods Covenant is and ought to be as precious as the memory of the worlds Creation; yet I hope he will not ſay that circumciſion and ſacrifices, (the old memorials of the Covenant) are therefore ſtill in force, or ought to be ſtill in uſe among Chriſtians who are intereſted in that Covenant. And the like may I ſay of the Saturday-Sabbath: Let none object the diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Old Sabbath and circumciſion, for they are both clad in a livery of the ſame colour, in many things they do much reſemble one another. Was<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 17.11.</note> circumciſion a ſign betwixt God and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> ſo was the<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 31.17.</note> old Sabbath betwixt God and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Was<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a perpetual Covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in their generation? So alſo was the<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 31.16.</note> Sabbath to be kept as a perpetual Covenant throughout their generations.</p>
               <p>In a word, was<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 17.14.</note> circumciſion ſo exacted, that whoſoever was uncircumciſed muſt be cut off from the houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> why, ſo alſo was the old<note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 31.14.</note> Sabbath, whoſoever doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny work therein, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among the people. Again, let none tax me with incongruity in comparing the old Sabbath and ſacrifices together; for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115959:21"/>the Lord of the Sabbath himſelf hath taught me to lay them in an equal ballance, who when the Phariſees clamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Diſciples for Sabbath breaking, ſtops their mouths with that<note n="g" place="margin">

In my poor judgment it is very conſiderable, that ſuch a perſon, at ſuch a time, ſhould match the Sabbath day and ſacrifices toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for it was not the Sabbath in general, but the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day which was then under diſpute. Surely there was ſome myſtery in this Divinity of our Saviour. But this may ſuffice for a firſt anſwer; As the Covenant of grace is perpetually to be commemorated, but not by circumciſion and ſacrifices, the old memorials of it; ſo the work of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is continually to be had in remembrace, but not by the old Sabbaths celebration: For we ſay, as the new Covenant muſt have new ſigns, ſo the new creation a new Sabbath. And</p>

                  </note> although it be primarily intended as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of redemption.

For in labouring ſix dayes, and reſting the ſeventh weekly, we recognize Gods working ſix dayes, and reſting the ſeventh originally. And here I may as rationally as <hi>T.T.</hi> appeal to any ingenuous Chriſtian, if the Old Sabbath ſerved the Jews as a means to keep them mindful both of the worlds Creation, and their redemption from <hi>Egypt;</hi> why may not our Lords day Sabbath be the Chriſtians <hi>memorandum,</hi> both of the worlds Creation,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.15.</note> and his Redemption from hell? Of the laſt moſt directly indeed, and that moſt deſervedly, being the greateſt work and the richeſt mercy; For although tis true, to have an earth to tread upon, an aire to breath in, light to look upon, creatures to live upon, are excellent mercies; yet to have an angry God reconciled, a ſinful nature repaired, Death and Hell vanquiſhed, Heaven and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115959:21"/>glory purchaſed and aſſured, is infinitely more bleſſed, more beneficial. To conclude; If I muſt conſecrate a weekly Sabbath to the Lord, what day more proper, more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more ſignificant, then that which bears a lively inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptior of the Lord my Redeemer, not without ſome comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of God my Creator?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the old ſeventh day may ſtill he retained in memory of the Creation, and the Lords day be celebrated too in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Redemption (though not as a Sabbath;) both dayes may lovingly live together among Chriſtians redeemed from the earth.</hi>

Thus we have conſidered the ground of the Sabbaths inſtitution in the firſt ſenſe, as Gods ending his work may be underſtood in reſpect of <hi>Providence.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly</hi> and chiefly, God may be ſaid to have ended his work on the ſeventh day, in reſpect of the <hi>promiſe</hi> then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115959:23"/>manifeſted to have been given by Chriſts actual undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of his Mediatorſhip, and the Fathers reſt or complacency in that bleſſed undertaking of the Son. And here I doubt not but we ſhall make it appear by the light of Gods candle ſhining in the Scriptures, that the firſt inſtitution of the ſeventh day was founded not ſo much upon the memory of the Creation, as upon the firſt publication of Chriſt in the promiſe; and then it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably follow, that the day was made mutable in the firſt foundation of it. For a day fixed upon the making of a promiſe muſt needs be changed upon the making good of that promiſe. To make way for the framing of my argument, I ſhall premiſe theſe ſeven conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That man ſinned and fell the ſame day on which he was created, as has been already argued, and ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved in the cloſe of this poſition: neither ſhould it ſeem improbable or incredible to any, that ſo goodly a building ſhould be raiſed and ruinated both in one day; conſidering the foundation of it ſtood upon the tottering Sands of free-will, not the impregnable rock of free-grace and Chriſts righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As man fell ſuddenly, ſo Chriſt was promiſed ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and early. The merciful Lord would not let the Sun go down upon his wrath; but in the cool of the day, while the wound of mans fall was yet freſh and bleeding, he gave him that ſoveraign plaſter in the promiſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the fall of man brought corruption and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the whole Creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.17, 18. Rom. 8.21, 22.</note> ſubjecting it to the curſe of God, the conſequences whereof are miſery and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That therefore when it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. <hi>On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day God ended or perfected his work</hi> (for ſo the word may be rendered, and ſo it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14.) it may well bear this conſtruction, that upon the ſeventh day,<note place="margin">

                  </note> by the actual undertaking of Chriſt (newly promiſed to bring
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115959:24"/>about mans redemption,<note place="margin">So 2 Chron. 4 12.</note> and the worlds reſtauration, the creatures were brought into a better ſtate then they were in before,<note place="margin">See more of this in that learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Mr. G <hi>Walker,</hi> intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sabbath.</note> as corrupted and defaced by the ſin of man. This is certain, that upon the ſixth day the creation was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fully perfected, as to natural perfection. Therefore when it is ſaid, on the ſeventh day God perfected his works, it may well be underſtood of a further and higher degree of perfection, even that which was ſupernatural, ſhewing a higher and more excellent end of all things created then that which at firſt they were created unto. At leaſt it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes ſuch a perfection as conſiſted in the creatures reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the mediation of Chriſt, which made way for the ſetting of all to rights again. A moſt bleſſed and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tranſaction for a ſin-ſhattered world, which had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been demoliſhed and laine buried in its own ruines, had not the bleſſed Son of God put to his gracious helping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. Theſe are no humane fancies, for<note n="a" place="margin">Coloſ. 1.17. Heb. 1.3. Pſal. 75.3.</note> the Scriptures do abundantly teſtifie that the Lord Chriſt is the great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter and repairer of the Creation; without whom we have reaſon to think that the Sun would not ſhine one day, nor the world ſtand one moment. Hence</p>
               <p n="5">5. It followes that God reſted on the ſeventh day: That is, not only ceaſed from his work, but found reſt in his Son; he reſted and was refreſhed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.17 that is, with a reſt full of ſweetneſs and delight, ſuch as he finds only in Chriſt in whom his ſoul delighteth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.2. And hence again it is ſaid,</p>
               <p n="6">6. That God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it; how did he bleſſe it, but by ordaining it as a day of Grace and ſpiritual bleſſings to the ſouls of his people during the Old Teſtament? Now this kind of bleſſing was utterly inconſiſtent with that covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency; there was no Grace, no Chriſt in that Covenant: But all ſpiritual bleſſings flow from Chriſt that fountain of the Gardens.<note place="margin">Eph. 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115959:24"/>the Lord then ordain the ſeventh day to be a day of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings to the ſouls of his people? Why ſtill this ſtrongly argues that Chriſt in the promiſe lay at the bottom of that day in the firſt deſignation of it; for he was that bleſſed ſeed in whom it was all along promiſed that the nations and families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. I would ask <hi>T.T.</hi> and his followers whether the bleſſings which they expect by vertue of the old Sabbaths Inſtitution be new Covenant-bleſſings? If ſo, then they cannot deny but the day thus bleſſed was bottomed upon Chriſt, The foundation of the new Covenant.<note n="a" place="margin">Iſai. 42.6.</note> I ſay upon Chriſt in the promiſe, that renowned promiſe of bleſſed memory, the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head; which promiſe was firſt made to <hi>Adam</hi> the father of men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15 and afterwards renewed to<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 12.3. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 18.22. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 28.4.</note>

This conſideration will out deep in the adverſaries cauſe: and to ſet the better edge upon it, let it be further conſidered.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, the Holy Ghoſt has fully aſſured us, that Chriſt in the promiſe was of the ſame antiquity with the confeſſed ground of the ſeventh dayes Sabbath.<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 3.3, 4.</note> The Apoſtle confeſſes that one ground or occaſion of ſingling out that preciſe ſeventh day was Gods ending his work, evidenced by his entring upon his reſt.

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115959:25"/>
               <p>Now by the foot-ſteps of theſe two Texts compared, how viſibly may we trace the Antiquity of Chriſt in the promiſe, and find a Saviour promiſed before a Sabbath inſtituted? The ſeventh day-Sabbath was inſtituted upon Gods finiſhing of his works; now as the works were finiſhed from the foundation of the world, ſo Chriſt was ſlain from the foundation of the world; ſlain, I ſay, in reſpect of his Fathers promiſe, and his own perſonal beginning to undertake that work which he was to perform in a way of ſuffering and dying; ſo that when the Father ended his work of Creation, the Son entred upon his work of redemption, and thereby added a further perfection to the firſt work, <hi>Whereupon God reſted the ſeventh day and bleſſed it:</hi> That is, appointed it for a day of ſpiritual bleſſings, upon the account of Chriſt the promiſed and bleſſed ſeed. All which particulars premiſed, it will be a truth of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable evidence, that the inſtitution of the old ſeventh day, was founded and bottomed upon Chriſt in the promiſe. And now a dim eye may eaſily diſcern mutability lying at the very foundation of the day; and thus it may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: A day founded upon Chriſt in the promiſe muſt neceſſarily be changed when the promiſe ſhall be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>

               </p>
               <p>The propoſition needs no confirmation; or if it does, take it thus: If the greateſt duty founded upon Chriſt in the promiſe was to vary and change with the promiſe, how much more the day? For inſtance, the great duty of believing in the Lord Jeſus; It cannot be denyed but one and the ſame Chriſt was the object of ſaving faith in all ages, before the law, under the law, and under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8. Rev. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ Jeſus the ſame yesterday, to day and for ever;</hi> being he <hi>which was, and which is, and which is to come.</hi> And ſo the faith of Gods elect which was, and is, and is to come, looks to the ſame object. But yet according to the different ſtate of the object, the eye of faith has had a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115959:25"/>different and various aſpect. Old Teſtament-believers who went before looked to him that ſhould come after; we that come after in the New Teſtament, look to him that is gone before. As long as Chriſt was in the promiſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Meſſiah to come; now the promiſe is fulfilled, we believe and know that the Son of God is come. And though ſtill we look for his ſecond coming to judge the world,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.20.</note> yet his firſt coming to ſave the world by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Incarnation, his bitter Paſſion, and glorious reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we no longer expect as to come, but look upon as already come and gone. Well then, you ſee how this great duty of believing circumſtantially varies and changes with the promiſe; and why? becauſe it was founded upon Chriſt in the promiſe. And verily, if the old Sabbath had the ſame foundation (as we have proved) then it muſt admit of the ſame variation. As long as Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the promiſe, the ſeventh day from the Creation was the Sabbath day; but now the promiſe is accompliſhed the<note n="*" place="margin">Note that well.</note>

And as we cannot now call that true faith which looks upon the Meſſiah as yet to come, in the ſenſe above mentioned; ſo neither can we count that the true Sabbath which leans upon the promiſe of a Meſſiah to come. Look to it, if you keep the old ſeventh day you muſt keep Chriſt ſtill in the old promiſe, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Jews Sabbath profeſs the Jews faith, the twelfth Article of whoſe curſed Creed is this; <hi>I believe with perfect faith that the Meſſiah is yet to come.</hi>

For the clearing of which let it be premiſed, that whereas the fourth Commandment is the only precept in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which concerns the Sabbath:</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115959:27"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do moſt freely grant, that the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a moral and perpetual precept, yet not moral natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (unleſs it be in the firſt clauſe concerning a day of reſt in general) but rather moral poſitive, and in the ſubſtance of it perpetual. I ſay in the ſubſtance of it, becauſe it is the judgment of ſome learned and godly, that the whole Decalogue, as well as the fourth Commandment, was in ſome circumſtances peculiar to the Jewes by reaſon of the time, place, and people to whom it was delivered: But the ſubſtance of it is common to all, like as almoſt all Scripture is for ſubſtance common, and for circumſtance proper and peculiar, becauſe much of it was written oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, as Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> obſerves. Now that which is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall and occaſional in a moral Law may be muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and yet the ſubſtance of the Law be perpetual; as the preface prefixed to the firſt Commandment, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe annexed to the fifth, being both circumſtantially pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Jews, were in that reſpect mutable, yet the Commandments themſelves remain immutable, and belong to us as well as to them. So in this fourth Commandment, that which indirectly and occaſionally reſpected the Jews might admit of a circumſtantial alteration, and yet the Commandment it ſelf in all the ſubſtantials of it be as much in force to us as ever it was to them; that is, for ſuch a numeral day, though not the ſame individual day, for one day in ſeven though not the old ſeventh, which might be, and (for ought I can ſee to the contrary) is changed upon a double account; in reſpect of the promiſe upon which it was inſtituted, as a ceremonial (at leaſt) a temporary ordinance, and in reſpect of the precept by which it was obſerved, as an occaſional circumſtance.<note place="margin">In the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it.</note> And therefore we need not (as ſome do) make the Commandment partly moral and partly ceremonial, but grant it wholly moral, and hold the day mutable, as indirectly and occaſionally pointed at as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was in the fifth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And thus the change of the day is no prejudice at all to the morality of the Commandment, as not being of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115959:28"/>the ſubſtance of it. Indeed to have altered the number from one day of ſeven, to one day of ten, or from one of ſeven to two of ſeven ordinarily, had been to wound the precept in the ſubſtantials of it, and in plain terms to blot out one of Gods ten Commandments; not ſo, to alter the day from one ſeventh to another ſeventh, which was but a circumſtantial variation. To thoſe that affirm the fourth Commandment to be temporary in reference to the proportion of one day in ſeven, becauſe in that point we grant it poſitive, I have only this to ſay, that we judg it not to be meerly poſitive, but moral poſitive, and ſo perpetual, as the event hath proved it. For although the particular day were changed by the refurrection of Chriſt, yet the proportion of one day in ſeven has been ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved inviolable by the practiſe of the Apoſtles and Churches ever ſince. And (as one well obſerves) no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolid reaſon can be rendred why the Apoſtles and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches ſhould weekly celebrate the day of Chriſts reſurrection, if it had not been in reference to the fourth Commandment: had not their conſciences been under the binding power of this precept, why might they not have done by the reſurrection day, as after ages have by the Incarnation, the Paſſion or the Aſſention day, have kept it once a year only, not once a week, as they did, and we do? But this by the way, to illuſtrate my conceſſion, which is this, that the fourth Commandment for the ſubſtance of it, that is for a Sabbath in general, yea, a ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and that of Gods appointment, is a moral and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual precept, this I freely grant and firmly believe. But</p>

That the old ſeventh day is either in part or in the whole,<note place="margin">De ſubſtautia praecepti non eſt ut ſeptimum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em preciſe quo etiam Deus ceſſavit ab operibus ſanctificemus, ſed dicm quieti conſecratum à Deo ipſo mediatè vel immediatè. <hi>Zanch. in</hi> praec. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> the moral ſubſtance of this Commandment, or that the morality of the law-lyes in the particularity of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115959:28"/>day, this I utterly deny. And I ſhall (with the reſt of my Brethren) affirm and maintain the contrary as an undoubted truth of God: Namely, that the fourth Commandment doth principally, and properly (and as the moral ſubſtance of it) preſcribe only ſuch a proportion, one day in ſeven at Gods appointment, to be ſpent in holy reſt; not this or that particular ſeventh day unleſs it be indirectly and occaſionally. To explicate this, the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is uſually and aptly alledged as a commentary upon the fourth; the form of worſhip and the time of worſhip being neerly allyed to each other. Now as in the ſecond Commandment, we have the rule of ſolemn worſhip in general, without ſpecifying the particular ordinances of worſhip, whether ſacrifices and offerings, as under the Law; or Prayer, Preaching, Baptiſme, and breaking of bread, as under the Goſpel; all which we re conſequentially injoyned in the ſecond Commandment, but neither of them directly: in like manner, in this fourth commandment we have a rule for the ſolemn time of worſhip a ſeventh day, or one in ſeven at Gods appointment; But whether it ſhould be reckoned from the worlds Creation, or from Chriſt reſurrection is not here determined; particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of worſhip, and the particular day of worſhip being to vary and change with the different age and ſtate of the Church. The wiſdome of the Law-giver has ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe two Commandments, that both the day and the duties (as occaſionals) might be changed without any change of his moral and immutable Lawes.</p>
               <p>But there is native light and evidence enough in the fourth Commandment it ſelf to convince us of this truth.<note place="margin">Prov. 6.23.</note> For (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes) <hi>the Commandment is a Lamp and the Law is light.</hi> Only we muſt look to the ſenſe, and not wholly liften to the ſound of the letter; for in all lawes the meaning of the Law-giver,<note place="margin">

               </list>
               <p>Now if all theſe four parts of the Commandment be directly for a ſeventh day in number or proportion, and but indirectly occaſionally and conſequentially, for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day in order, then the ſubſtance of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for one day of ſeven, not the laſt of ſeven. But the premiſes are true, and to demonſtrate their truth, let us come to tryal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall examine the Preceptive part, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day,</hi> or day of reſt, <hi>to keep it holy.</hi> This I hope is not be reſtrained to the old ſeventh day: <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>ſeventh</hi> day cannot be terms convertible here, for then there were a tautology in the Commandment, as Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey</hi> obſerves. It were as if God ſhould ſay, Remember the ſeventh day Sabbath, the ſeventh day is the Sabbath; which is ſuch a flat tautology, as the God of Wiſdome will never own in ſo ſhort a ſumme of words; No, its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115959:29"/>evident that hitherto the precept is comprehenſive and large, not limitted to one day more then another; for Sabbath day (if you will hear the Hebrew word ſpeak Engliſh) is no more but a day of reſt, and that is any day ſet apart for ſolemn worſhip by divine authority. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the firſt day of the week as much as ever it was to the laſt. A judicious Author does piouſly and pithily illuſtrate it by that ſecond table precept, <hi>Honour the King;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> late of <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17.</note> If <hi>Saul</hi> be King, honour him, if he be dead or diſplaced, and <hi>David</hi> be King, then honour King <hi>David.</hi> To neither of them directly, but ſucceſſively, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially it might be accommodated to both. So, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the day of reſt to ſanctifie it, while the old ſeventh day was the day of reſt, the Jews were bound to ſanctifie that; If that be changed, and the firſt day of the week be choſen in its room, we are as much bound to ſanctifie that, and this by the ſame law; for as the change of the perſon took not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the precept of honouring the King,<note place="margin">Hac enim ratione nos quoque proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum hoc ſervamus, dum ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficamus diem dominicum, quia hic quietis nobis eſt dies ſicut Judaels fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it ſeptimus. <hi>Zanch. in</hi> praec. <hi>Col. 2. Syg.</hi>
                  </note> ſo the change of the day made not void the command of ſanctifying the Sabbath. And thus, as learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> tells us; We Chriſtians keep the Sabbath as much as ever the Jewes did in keeping holy the Lords day, which is a day of holy reſt as well as their was. For if it be a day of holy rejoycing, it muſt needs be a day of holy reſt, ſince it is both improper and impoſſible to keep a ſet or ſolemn day as a day of holy rejoycing in Chriſt, and at the ſame time to follow our worldly imployments; worldly labour, and the ſweat of the brow has too much of the curſe in it, to conſiſt with a day of thanksgiving or holy rejoycing in the Lord.<note place="margin">The Scripture frequently calls feſtival dayes Sabbaths; and if Sabbath be a ſit name for other dayes of the ſame nature, Why not for this?</note> And therefore I cannot but wonder that <hi>T.T.</hi> who grants the Lords day to be a day of rejoycing, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Let us rejoyce

                  </label> the fifth Commandment, <hi>Honour thy father and mother,</hi> is to be underſtood of ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parents as were then living, and none but them: And then the Quakers will have a fine plea for their barbarous rudeneſs and unmannerly behaviour towards ſuperiours. Tell them of honouring their parents; that's a wilderneſs-duty, may they ſay, it intended only the Iſraelites parents, now tis a dead letter and out of date. As ſimple and ſottiſh a plea as this would be, yet it is no better to ſay the fourth Commandment intended only the Jews Sabbath, and the old ſeventh day, becauſe that was only in being when the precept was given. Alas! that was meerly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional and accidental to the Commmandment, not at all of the eſſence or ſubſtance of it. True, that was the only weekly Sabbath then, but it was not alwayes ſo to be, as the event hath proved. But the truth is, this firſt clauſe, <hi>Remember the Sabath day to keep it holy,</hi> did directly point at no peculiar day more then another; but being the law
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115959:30"/>of nature, it only requires a day of reſt in general to be ſanctified; to wit, what day ſoever it fall upon. And this is very conſiderable, ſince in the judgment of all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.12.</note> the prime morality and main ſubſtance of the Commandment lies in this clauſe.

The terme <hi>ſeventh</hi> is oppoſed to all other numbers, either ninth, tenth, or twentieth; as alſo to the ſix working-dayes, which clearly intend ſuch a number, as ſix in ſeven, and ſo the ſeventh day is as much as one in ſeven. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour but</hi> a <hi>ſeventh day is the Sabbath;</hi> a ſeventh, what ſeventh? pray note it, the Lord ſayes not, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth from the Creation, he nameth no day, if he had, the law had been limitted to that day; but becauſe the law-giver intended to chuſe a new day, and not to change his old law, you ſee he has left it in large and general terms, neither can it be reſtrained to one day more then to another. To make it plain by a ſimilitude or two; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a rich man who has ſeven Lambs, in a way of unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bounty make ſuch a propoſal as this to his poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I will freely give you ſix of them, upon condition you keep the ſeventh for me, not naming which ſeventh, muſt he neceſſarily intend one ſeventh more then another? I ſhould rather think no, but any one of the ſeven, being left to his own liberty to chuſe which he pleaſes. Or thus, Suppoſe a liberal Maſter who has ſeven pounds to diſpoſe of, indent thus with his Servant, I freely give or lend thee ſix of them, provided thou improve the ſeventh for me; What, muſt he needs intend this or that ſpecial ſeventh, (ſuppoſing ſome piece of gold among the reſt?) Certainly no, every man may know his meaning, by the ſeventh
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115959:31"/>pound he intends one pound of ſeven. The accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is eaſie and appoſite; the bountiful and bleſſed God freely beſtows ſix dayes in the week upon his creature man, reſerving the ſeventh to himſelf, that is one in ſeven at his own choice and appointment: This is the direct and principal intendment of the Law. Though I deny not that the old ſeventh day was indirectly and occaſionally here pointed at, as a ſeventh day then under Divine <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and the Jewes were bound by this Commandment to keep that day, as by the fifth commandment they were bound to honour their particular parents then living, yet both theſe being but occaſional circumſtances, might be and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without any impeachment to the morality of theſe Commands. The altering of a mutable circumſtance ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of time, place or perſon, is far from aboliſhing the ſubſtance of a law; indeed if the Sabbath had been changed (as I ſaid before) either to the ſixth day, or the tenth day, the whole frame of the Commandment had been broken and ſhattered; but in the change of one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day to another, upon a ſufficient ground, and by a ſufficient authority; the ſubſtance of the Law ſuffers not at all; the ſubſtance of it is for one day in ſeven directly and no more; the ſeventh day is the Sabbath. To thoſe forementioned vulgar caſes I will adde ſome Scripture-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for the further clearing of it. As thus, why may not the ſeventh part of mans time, and the tenth part of his temporals be underſtood in a parallel ſenſe?<note place="margin">Levit. 27.30. Deut. 18.21.</note> Now one part of ten. is principally intended in the Law of tithes, ſurely when God commandeth the tenth, any man will think he hath more reſpect to the number then the order; ſuch a proportion, then ſuch a particular in it: Although indeed (as judicious Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> notes) in one particular there was a law to reſtrain it to the laſt of ten; of all their Cattel the tenth that came under the rod was holy to the Lord; which law, as he ſayes well,<note place="margin">Levit. 27.23.</note> need not have been added, if the general law for tithes had intended the laſt of ten. And this is the very caſe here, one day in ſeven is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115959:32"/>chiefly and directly intended in this law of the Sabbath,<note place="margin">The ſeventh day in every week Chriſt hath now limited by his Apoſtles to the Lords day. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in Gal. 4.10.</note> neither can any more be well gathered from it, unleſs ſome other law be produced to reſtrain it to the laſt of ſeven as once it was, or to the firſt of ſeven as now it is reſtrained; ſome other law I ſay, for there is no ſuch particular reſtriction in theh fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. For I pray obſerve this, the Commandment doth not point out the day by way of inſtitution, but only preſcribe the obſervation of it; ſuppoſing it either as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inſtituted, or to be inſtituted elſewhere, either in the Old Teſtament or the New. Again, to that which others have gathered to my hand, let me adde one Scripture-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more; why may not that tribute of time which God calls for, and that tribute of their lands which <hi>Joſeph</hi> compacted for with the Egyptians, be taken in a like ſenſe, ſince the things themſelves are not much unlike?<note place="margin">Gen. 47.24.</note>

And truely varying but the circumſtances, me thinks the Lord ſpeaks much to the ſame effect in this fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, but</hi> a <hi>ſeventh,</hi> or the <hi>ſeventh is the Sabbath;</hi> that is, dividing the week into ſeven parts, thou ſhalt have ſix of them for thy common work, and I will have one in ſeven for my ſolemn worſhip: He does not ſay the ſeventh day from Creation, that was ordered elſewhere <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. But a ſeventh in proportion directly, this or that ſeventh indirectly, and by conſequence only.</p>
               <p>Yea to proceed to demonſtration, that this is unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably the mind of God may be thus made out.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115959:32"/>
               <p>This proportion is no where directly ſtated by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual precept, unleſs it be in this fourth Commandment: Therefore it muſt be ſo determined here.</p>
               <p>That it muſt be ſomewhere determined, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſubſtantially profitable to Religion, the glory of God and the good of ſouls; (as Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> has invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly argued) for if men were left to their own liberty to chuſe their own proportion, in all probability, Religion would be ſubſtantially prejudiced and damnified by it; either it would be ſtarved with too little, or ſurfetted with too much Sabbath-time; either Popery would create almoſt every day in the week a holy day, or profaneneſs would be content with one day in a moneth: Let ſinful man have liberty to pluck up Gods bounds, and alter his proportion either one way or other, and experience will ſoon ſhew the inconvenience of it: Let it be altered from one of ſeven to one of ten or twenty, and what a deadly blow to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would that be? Yea, let the alteration be on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, from one of ſeven to two of ſeven, may we not juſtly ſuſpect more prejudice then profit by ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration? Would not one ſabbath be able to juſtle out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and one day diſturb the holy reſt of another? Truly as our Saviour ſpeaks in another caſe:<note place="margin">Luke 19.30.</note> 
                  <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters, but either he will have the one, and love the other, or hold to the one and diſpiſe the other.</hi> So we may probably think in this caſe, no man can ordinarily obſerve two Sabbaths in a week, but either he will ſlight the one to keep the other, or it may be in a little time ſlight both and keep neither.<note place="margin">Whether the Sabbath ſhould be kept once a week or once a moneth cannot be gathered from any plain or perpetual precept, unleſs from the fourth Commandment: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. is not plain and direct; <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.15. no perpetual precept. The Old Teſtament affords no other but the fourth Commandment for one day in ſeven, as direct.</note> Alter Gods proportion which way you will, and religion will be ſubſtantially damnified by it, but no ſuch damage ariſes from the change of the particular day for another and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſince God and the ſoul have the ſame proportion ſtill (one day in ſeven) though the old ſeventh day be diſplaced. Therefore I conclude, the proportion and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115959:33"/>not the particular day is directly determined in this moral and perpetual law, for elſewhere it is not. As for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar day, whether firſt or laſt of ſeven it falls under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as having a ſeventh part of time appointed falling upon it and no otherwiſe. But I might have ſpared this argument, for the term, <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> is large enough in it ſelf, ſince it is not ſaid, the ſeventh day from the Creation or any other period or date of time, but ſeventh day in general. And what high preſumption is it in <hi>T.T.</hi> to reſtrain the word <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi> where no reaſon doth conſtrain? What's this but to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the holy one of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Iſalm 119.96.</note> to clip the wings of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and narrow it up to his own notion, when the Commandment in it ſelf is exceeding broad? but to proceed,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſult the <hi>argumentative part</hi> of the precept, <hi>viz.</hi> that which contains the principal argument and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to inforce the Sabbaths obſervation, and that is Gods example in theſe words, <hi>(for in ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and reſted the ſeventh day:)</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, the reaſon why I would have you obſerve the forementioned proportion of weekly time, ſix dayes for labour, and a ſeventh for reſt, is this, becauſe I my ſelf kept this proportion in the beginning of time, working ſix dayes and reſting but one in ſeven.</p>
               <p>Note it well Gods example is not propounded as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſeventh day from Creation directly, but more generally for a ſeventh day in proportion, For the example can intend no more then the foregoing clauſe, of which it is brought as a reaſon, and that is no more but one day in ſeven directly, not appropriated to any particular day, as we prov<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115959:33"/>or the laſt of ſeven? If you ſay, the laſt of ſeven is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the argument of Gods example; I anſwer, every circumſtance in an argument is not argumentative; and although that day be intimated in the example, yet it is not ſo much argumentatively as hiſtorically propounded? An example is not to be neceſſarily imitated in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it.

Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the ſupper in the evening indeed becauſe it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſucceed the Paſſeover, which was an evening ordinance, and the ſame evening or night in which he was betrayed, becauſe the next day he was to ſuffer. Both theſe were occaſional, and therefore neither of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual; and beſides, we may well conceive that our Lord did this in the evening, and after the Paſſeover, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the aboliſhing both of the paſſeover and the evening; and to leave the time free to his Church ever after, as a late Writer has judiciouſly obſerved. Let not the Reader call this a digreſſion,<note place="margin">Non eſt ocioſum quia non infru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuoſum loqua citas nulla in ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificatione tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, <hi>Tertull. de</hi> patientia.</note> for there is properly no digreſſion in that which may conduce to edification; neither is it impertinent as long as it is not unprofitable. But to return to our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſuppoſe the old ſeventh day were indirectly and circumſtantially commended to the Jews by Gods example, yet it followes not that the ſame day is ſtill in force to us, becauſe circumſtantials in a moral law (as we ſaid before) are changeable without any change in the ſubſtance of the law: I do not ſay they are abrogable as ceremonies, but alterable as circumſtances; they may be changed for better things, and not a tittle of the law annulled, but rather ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by it; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>till heaven and earth paſs one jot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.18.</note> 
                  <hi>or one tittle ſhall not paſs from the law till all be fulfilled.</hi> I ſay, the law is not deſtroyed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fulfilled by the varying of ſome circumſtances, as by changing their typical deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> into our ſpiritual deliverance from ſin; and the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> meant in the fifth Commandment into <hi>England</hi> where we dwell. And becauſe the fourth Commandment and the fifth are neer neighbours, methinks the one may fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

                  </note> that the promiſed land intended occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally in the fifth Commandment was the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> neither do I deny, that the day on which God is ſaid to reſt in the fourth Commandment was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day from Creation; yet all will grant that the argument or inducement of the fifth Commandment is not to be reſtrained to that land only, for then it were no argument at all to us. Now I would ask any rational man, why the argument of this fourth Commandment ſhould be limited to that particular day from Creation, more then the argument of the fifth Commandment to that particular land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſince both the one and the other are but occaſionally inſinuated? And to limit the inducement of a moral law to an occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtance, is the ready way to evacuate and make void the whole law. But we ſhall put it out of all doubt, that Gods example here propounded is only for one day in ſeven directly, ſubſtantially and properly; for the old ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth only conſequentially, indirectly or occaſionally; and that by a double conſideration.</p>

And where God has left a latitude, we may not dare to put a limitation, that were to encloſe Gods Common, and intrench upon his Royalty: Well, then the Rule being only expreſs for a ſeventh day in general, the reaſon or argument here brought to perſwade to the obſervation of ſuch a general ſeventh, is taken from Gods example, who alſo reſted a ſeventh day; which although it were the laſt of ſeven, yet being only alledged as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the forementioned rule, it can ſignifie no more then the rule it ſelf of which it is a reaſon: And ſo it is clear, that the ſenſe of this latter clauſe <hi>(in ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and reſted the ſeventh)</hi> muſt be only according to the ſenſe of the former clauſe <hi>(ſix dayes ſhalt thou labour, but a ſeventh is the Sabbath)</hi> that is, a ſeventh in proportion directly. And thus the firſt day of the week is as much the Sabbath of the fourth Commandment to Chriſtians, as ever the laſt of the week was to the Jewes, being one day in ſeven as well as that. To diſpute for the ſame day on which God reſted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a neceſſity of obſerving that day, becauſe we muſt obſerve that proportion, is to argue <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> a well known fallacy. For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is only direct for ſuch a proportion (ſix for labour and a ſeventh every week for reſt) not this or that ſeventh from any prefixed period.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us look into the reaſon of this reaſon, and then the caſe will be yet more clear, the reaſon or equity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny law is the life and ſtrength of the law. And it is the deſign of Gods wiſdome in impoſing laws upon his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to propoſe ſuch reaſons in thoſe lawes as ſhall make

And hence Gods lawes are ſo often ſtyled, <hi>Judgments,</hi> becauſe in all things they are juſt and equal; and certainly that ſenſe of the argument which doth moſt ſhew the equity of the Commandment is the beſt and trueſt ſenſe. Now let us conſider the equity that Gods example carryes with it in reference to the aforeſaid proportion of ſix dayes for labour, and one in ſeven for reſt. As thus, if the great God who needs not a moment of time either for work or reſt, (as being neither ſubject to weakneſs nor wearineſs) if he, I ſay, were pleaſed when he had work to do (even a world to make) to take ſix dayes for his work, and one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for reſt, how much more ſhould we men ſtill hold to this proportion, who by reaſon of corporal weakneſs and ſpiritual wants need ſuch a competency of time, both for ſecular imployments and ſoul refreſhments? Thus there is convincing ſtrength of reaſon and equity in it. But now to argue for the particular day; God wrought firſt ſix dayes, and then reſted the laſt of ſeven, therefore we muſt firſt work and then reſt, has no ſuch argumentative force in it, eſpecially to us Chriſtians, who living under a Covenant of pure grace do rather work by reſt, then reſt by works; and therefoe (the Sabbath being ſuitable to the Covenant) we may rather judg it equitable to begin the week with a day of reſt, and work the ſix dayes after, then to work the ſix firſt dayes, and then reſt the laſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. Even dim-eyed nature judges it moſt equal to<note n="a" place="margin">A Jove prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with God,<note n="b" place="margin">Supervacua neceſſariis poſt-ponenda ſunt. <hi>Senec. ep. 49.</hi>
                  </note> and give the precedency to things moſt neceſſary; and grace both not gain-ſay it but rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; for is it not moſt reaſonable that I ſhould ſerve my gracious Lord in the duties of his worſhip, becauſe I ſerve my ſelf in the works of my calling? But the truth is, Gods example is neither directly for firſt or laſt of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but for one in ſeven perpetually. The force of Gods argument lies in this, that we ſhould dedicate one day in ſeven to reſt, for ſix working dayes indulged to our ſelves.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115959:36"/>And herein we imitate Gods example in labouring ſix dayes and reſting one in ſeven weekly. For farther ſatisfaction in this argument let the ingenuous Reader conſult Mr. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Dorch.</hi> two burning and ſhining Lights, who have gone before me: if any little ſpark be here added, let the Father of lights have all the glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly let us come to that which for memories-ſake I call the <hi>benedictive part</hi> of the Commandment (<hi>wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day,</hi> &amp;c.) obſerve the phraſe, not <hi>ſeventh</hi> day but <hi>Sabbath</hi> day or day of reſt is bleſſed.<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment both opens and ſhuts, begins and ends with the term Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, not ſeventh day.</note> Certainly, if the foregoing argument drawn from Gods example had intended only the ſeventh day from Creation, this concluſion flowing from that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had fallen upon that day alſo; but we ſee the term is evidently changed, that we may not miſtake Gods mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ſuppoſed ſtrictneſs in the term <hi>ſeventh day;</hi> ſee how the Lord condeſcends to our weakneſs writing <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day</hi> or day of reſt inſtead of ſeventh day: The Word <hi>Abbath</hi> like a finger points both forward and backward, directiug us how to expound the whole precept in a large, and not in a limited ſenſe. Doubtleſs if the Lord God had intended to tye up his Church in all ages to the ſeventh day from the Creation, he would have fixed the command upon that day only, eſpecially in the concluſion of it; why ſhould not that preciſe day be mentioned here as well as in the Inſtitution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. There he is ſaid to bleſs and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the ſeventh day, here only the Sabbath day: a more probable reaſon to me is not imaginable then this, the Commandment is of a larger extent then the Inſtitution. And beſides, the Inſtitution of the old day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. was but temporary and mutable, whereas the precept it ſelf is more and perpetual; ſee then how wiſely the Lord our Law-giver has contrived it, that it ſhould not be reſtrained to that particular ſeventh day. To conclude with this concluſion, the whole weight and ſtreſs of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſee leans upon large and general terms; the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115959:36"/>Preceptive part is for a day of reſt in general, the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive part is of the ſame latitude; and although the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day be placed in the middle betwixt both, yet it is not fixed upon one day more then another, unleſs it be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, which indeed is no fixure at all; what hinders therefore but the whole ſubſtance of the precept may ſtand in the fall of the day, ſince it was never incorporated into the moral ſubſtance of this or any other command. It is (I muſt needs ſay) a truth to me as evident as the light it ſelf, that the fourth Commandment in all the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of it makes as much for the Lords day (being one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Gods appointment) as ever it did for the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? And here I cannot ſufficiently admire and adore the depth of Divine wiſdome that the ever glorious God foreſeeing and foreappointing the change of the day, took care to contrive and pen the commandment in ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as might aptly ſuite the old day while it laſted, and as equally ſort with the new, now it is ſubſtituted in the roome of the old. That the Jewes (upon the diſcovery of ſo happy a change) might not loath their old Sabbath, the precept was occaſionally and circumſtantially fitted to that, and that we Chriſtians having a new, might not be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the old it is ſubſtantially adapted to this. I ſhall need add no more, if men did not wilfully wink, I ſhould thinke here were light enough in this Lamp of the Law to convince them. As for the adverſaries objections ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here and there in his book, they vaniſh like ſo many vapours before the Sun being brought forth and tryed by the evidence of this truth.</p>

So for the firſt Inſtitution of the Sabbath, God reſted on the ſeventh day from Creation; yet his example binds us only to a day of that number, not that particular day. See the new Annot. in Exod. 20. &amp; <hi>Atter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolls</hi> new Cov.</note> I anſwer as before, that Gods pattern or example is directly propounded in the Commandment, to point out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion not the particular day. The proportion, I ſay, of one day in ſeven for reſt in oppoſition to ſix working dayes. And therefore the number of Gods working dayes is ſpecified in the example, as well as the day of his reſt, <hi>(for in ſix dayes the Lord made Heaven, Earth, and Sea, and reſted the ſeventh day)</hi> plainly intimating, that the main force of the example is to bind us to ſuch a number of dayes, ſix for labour and one in a week for reſt, not ſuch an order as firſt or laſt of ſeven. Or admit there were ſome thing elſe in it; namely, that indirectly and occaſionally it did lead the Jews to that old ſeventh day, that is, during the ſignificancy of that day, and the ſupereminency of the firſt Creation; yet when a new Creation is finiſhed and a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115959:38"/>new reſt from a greater work manifeſted upon another day, that indirect and occaſional force of the example for the old day, muſt needs be out of force to us, being ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and ſwallowed up by the glory of a greater work and a better reſt upon another day. And that without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the precept at all, yea or the example either, in the direct ſcope of it for one day in ſeven. A new day might be and is inſtituted, and yet the main ſcope both of the precept and example ſtill obſerved, in our labouring ſix dayes and reſting every ſeventh. Only that which was circumſtantial and occaſional, is altered upon the account of the new Creatio or Redemption, which comparatively was to put out the memory of the old Creation, as it is plain, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.17. And that thus it ſhould be, that the occaſional force of Gods example (as to the old day) ſhould be out of force to us, and yet a weekly Sabbath to be ſtill obſerved by the moral and direct force of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, me thinks it is not obſcurely ſignified in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment it ſelf, if we do but compare two places toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. at the firſt giving of the Law in thunder and terrour,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.11. compared with Deut. 5.15.</note> the Sabbath is wholly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Creation, and Gods example in reſting from that work, as was ſaid before; but in the repetition or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-giving of the law by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a typical mediatour, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. you ſee the reaſon from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is quite left out, and the Sabbath is altogether infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a type of our Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, <hi>Remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of</hi> Egypt,<note place="margin">Mr. G. <hi>Abbot</hi> Vindic.

                  <hi>and the Lord brought thee thence by a mighty hand, therefore he commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day;</hi> lively intimating, (as a learned Author obſerves) the ſubſiſtence of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the Goſpel, and the binding authority of it by the incorporation of a new reaſon drawn from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or ſpiritual deliverance by Chriſt, inſtead of the old reaſon drawn from the Creation, which is here utterly omitted.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115959:38"/>conſidere, whether ſuch a repetition of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (not <hi>Seorſim,</hi> or by it ſelf alone, but together with the whole decalogue in its proper place and order) with ſuch a material omiſſion or alteration be not very ſignificant? and what can it more properly ſignifie then this, that under the ſecond and beſt diſpenſation of the Law (that is under the Goſpel) the main argument for our weekly Sabbath ſhould be the work of Redemption? Surely their deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> literally conſidered, was not comparable to the work of Creation, that it ſhould here be propounded as the reaſon of the Sabbath, and the other left out; but as a type of the moſt glorious and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious work of Redemption there was much weight in it.

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, No, it quite overthrowes it, for in as much as it ſignifies the weekly celebration of a Sabbath in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Redemption, rather then of Creation, it evidently implyes, that when this greater work ſhould be finiſhed the memory of the Creation upon which the old day was fixed, ſhould be ſwallowed up by the worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and then the day it ſelf muſt unavoidably be changed. Its true, while the type laſted, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was rather figured then fulfilled, the old day was ſtill to be obſeved; but when the type ſhould give place to the truth, the day alſo which went along with the type muſt neceſſarily expire with it. At leaſt our ſpiritual Redemption by Chriſt being much more glorious then their typical and temporal deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> muſt needs eate out the memory of the Creation, and ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the day, by antiquating the argument of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the indirect force of Gods example in reſting upon that day.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115959:39"/>I do not ſay, the direct and principal force of the example (for one day in ſeven) is evacuated. But rather that this number and proportion being ſtill obſerved by the Apoſtles in a new day, ſtrongly argues, that the inſerting of the forementioned argument inſtead of Gods example, does only make void the circumſtantial force of the example (for the old ſeventh day) not the ſubſtantial and moral equity of it for one day in ſeven. <hi>Quod orat reſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115959:42"/>the Creation was ever an expreſs tittle of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a ſeventh day in a week indeed is more then a tittle of the Law, and this number is ſtill continued in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords day all the Chriſtian world over: And I doubt not but it ſhall continue to the end of the world, although the old day be changed; as in the celebration of the Paſſeover the preciſe order of time was ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; for whereas the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth was the time appointed at firſt,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.18.</note> yet <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> great paſſeover was kept on the fourteenth day of the ſecond moneth.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 30.5.</note> Where you ſee the preciſe individual day altered upon occaſion; yet the number (the fourteenth day) ſtill obſerved.<note place="margin">See this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration further cleared by Mr. G. <hi>Abbot. p.</hi> 37. and Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. p.</hi> 49.</note> So upon a greater and better occaſion the Sabbath is altered (as to the day) yet the ſeventh day in number ſtill kept intire in this, as the fourteenth in the other.

               <p n="3">3. Another argument to inforce their obſervation of the Sabbath, is taken, from the <hi>moral equity</hi> of it, verſe 15. <hi>Six dayes may work be done, but the ſeventhis the Sabbath:</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, ye may well afford me one day

The caſe ſeems clearly to me to be ſtated in this wiſe: The old ſeventh day was at firſt given to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity as the only true Sabbath during the pre-eminency of the Creation, and Chriſt in the promiſe; and that it was conſcientiouſly kept by the holy Patriarchs for ſome ages after I doubt not (though ſome of the Ancients ſeem to deny it) but to be ſure, in tract of time the ſinful race of <hi>Adam,</hi> forſaking the true God, did alſo forget the true Sabbath.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115959:44"/>by the will and appointment of God? For if the Jews ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration be extinct, and they that were once the people of God, have now a <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> written upon them,<note place="margin">Ho. 11.20. 1 Theſ. 2.15, 16.</note>

I ſpeak not this, as inſulting over the miſery of the Jews, but as lamenting the ſin of apoſtate Chriſtians, who take up that day as a badge of their Saintſhip, which the infidel Jews wear as a badge of their blaſphemy and enmity againſt Chriſt and Chriſtians. Indeed it was once an illuſtrious ſign of their ſanctification; but it was limited to their generations, as the Paſſeover was, and therefore if the one be expired, ſo is the other upon the ſame account. And in this reſpect I dare boldly affirm, and I doubt not to maintain it, that it is every whit as lawful for a Chriſtian to celebrate that old Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Paſſeover, as to obſerve the old Sabbath. For the one was as well a ſign as the other, and the one was ordained for a ſeaſon as well as the other.

                     <hi>pa.</hi> 145.</note> For the Father was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as the inſtitutor of a Sabbath, therefore ſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, even ſo muſt the Son be honoured. The argument is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ponderous, if we conſider the ſcope of our Saviours oration, which was to juſtifie what he had done on the Sabbath-day. To this purpoſe he pleades his deſignment to do greater things then theſe, and ſome greater thing in reference to command and diſpoſall over the Sabbath; which was the thing in queſtion. And this plea he proves by his power to raiſe the dead, and to diſpoſe of all things in a way of judicature or government under the new Teſtament, as the Father had done under the Old; and to this intent, that all men ſhould honour the Son as they honour the Father; which being ſpoken with reference to the Sabbath, and to his preſent diſpenſing with it, doth plainly ſpeake his intention to alter and change it.</p>
               <p>Again, here is one thing more obſervable, namely, that Chriſts power to raiſe the dead, and his power to diſpoſe of the Sabbath, are carryed along both together in this diſcourſe. And the one is made an argument of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; plainly intimating the change of the day upon the reſurrection, upon his own reſurrection in the firſt place, which is hinted at (verſe 26.) and others with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115959:48"/>at his reſurrection; according to that ancient prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live,</hi>

                  <hi>together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe;</hi> which was fulfilled when our Saviour roſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>So that all things conſidered, here is a moſt pregnant Scripture to prove that it was our Redeemers purpoſe to alter the Sabbath: And therefore (as in Preface to ſuch a thing) he both gives the man a commiſſion to carry his bed on that day, and pleads for what he had done by his divine authority, as beginning to ſhake the day, which within two years after was to be unhinged and actually changed for another; at leaſt it ſpeaks his power to alter it. And he that ſhall dare deny this, muſt make Chriſt Jeſus the Lord inferiour to <hi>David</hi> the ſervant; for even <hi>David</hi> had power to alter a circumſtance in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 23.24, 25, 26.</note> ordaining that the Levites ſhould officiate at twenty years old,<note place="margin">Numb. 4.3.

               <p>Well, if he had power to alter it, then it was alterable; which was the thing to be proved. If it be ſaid, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, what the Lord could do, but what he did; whether he did indeed alter the Sabbath as to the day: I anſwer, we ſhall put this queſtion out of queſtion in the next Poſition.</p>

And that the old can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand is evident, becauſe the foundation on which it ſtood (the memory and celebrity of the worlds Creation) is ſwallowed up by the glory of a greater work;<note place="margin">Sicuti Sol exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens ſtellis eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit ſuum fulgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. <hi>Calv. in Loc.</hi>

Now let us ſee what may be argued from this Scripture: that the Prophet here points at Goſpel-times is plain enough, yea, the whole ſucceſſion of Goſpel-times: for the things here propheſied of are ſuch as run parallel with the Church ſtate of the Gentiles, and the conſtituting of a publick Miniſtry choſen from among them. Again, that new things are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by theſe old names, is without diſpute; a Goſpel-miniſtry by Prieſts and Levites, (diſtinct from the Levitical prieſthood) and why not by Sabbaths and new Moons, ſelect ſeaſons of worſhip under the Goſpel, diſtinct from thoſe under the Law? For that it cannot be meant of the old Sabbath, and Old Teſtament-times of worſhip, may be thus demonſtrated: That interpretation which would render the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a falſe Prophet cannot be true; But to interpret this prophecy <hi>(from moneth to moneth, and from Sabbath to Sabbath all fleſh ſhall come and worſhip before the Lord)</hi> of the Jews Saturday-Sabbath, would render the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a falſe Prophet, ſince the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe ſixteen hundred years can teſtifie, that no fleſh at all, (or none to ſpeak of) have owned that day as a day of ſolemn worſhip, but expound it of the Chriſtian Sabbath, and ſo it holds true to a tittle; for the firſt day of the week has been owned and obſerved by all Churches, in all ages, ever ſince the Sun of righteouſneſs aroſe on that day: and thus what the Lord foretold by his Prophet he has fulfilled by his Providence, and this ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy proves the teſtimony of Jeſus. And ſo (I ſuppoſe) we have found even Old Teſtament-proof of a New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Sabbath;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115959:51"/>or (which comes all to one) the ordinary ſtated ſeaſon of ſolemn worſhip under the Goſpel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that under the Law; and all this in cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the new Creation: for <hi>verſe</hi> 22. it is ſaid, <hi>As the new heavens and new earth which I will make ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main before me, ſo ſhall your name and your ſeed remain;</hi> and then preſently it followes, <hi>from moneth to moneth, and Sabbath to Sabbath, all fleſh ſhall come and worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Thus the Major or firſt Propoſition is made good, that the new Creation muſt have a new Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>The old Covenant in the ſpecial (at leaſt) in all the ſymbolical and ſhadowy branches of it, was changed by Chriſt when the new Covenant was fully exhibited: But the old Sabbath (in reſpect of the day) was a ſpecial, yea a ſymbolical and

               </p>
               <p>This Argument (how new ſoever it may ſeem at firſt) upon trial will be found true (I doubt not) in every material term and tittle of it; for that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus has changed the old Covenant (I mean the Covenant of grace, as to the<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7.6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But that which I chiefly take hold of in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. the term <hi>[Covenant;]</hi> here the old Sabbath is called by the name of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, therefore ſure it was neer akin to it, a ſpecial branch, yea, a ſhadowy branch of it, as we ſhall ſhortly ſee; and being ſo, how naturally will it follow, that the Covenant being changed in reſpect of the form, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be a change of the Sabbath in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the time or day, and that by the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115959:53"/>that as the old Covenant had the old ſeventh day and old Sacrament-ſeals annexed to it,<note place="margin">See <hi>Widley's</hi> Treatiſe of the Sabb. <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note> ſo the new Covenant might have new ſeals and a new day; even as in contracts and Covenants renewed betwixt man and man, 'tis required, that as they be new drawn, ſo alſo new dated, and new ſealed.</p>
               <p>To prevent miſtakes (by the way) let this be hinted, that I do not here intend any change of the Covenant in reſpect of the eſſence and ſubſtance of it; for I grant that when the Holy-Ghoſt ſpeaks of the new Covenant as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the old, it is not to be underſtood in reſpect of the matter and ſubſtance, but circumſtance, and manner of expreſſure; as the ſame Commandment is ſaid to be both<note n="e" place="margin">1 John 2.7, 8.</note> old and new, and the ſame way to heaven both<note n="f" place="margin">Hebr. 10.20.</note> new and<note n="g" place="margin">Hebr. 13.8.

And that ſuch a change of the Covenant there is, and ſuch a change of the Sabbath by one and the ſame Chriſt,<note n="i" place="margin">Hebr. 12.24.</note> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Covenant, and<note n="k" place="margin">Mark 2.28.</note> Lord of the Sabbath, and both theſe occaſioned by the exhibition of a new and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant upon his glorious reſurrection from the dead, we come now to demonſtrate.

'Tis true, in the ſubſtance and morality of it it was equally calculated both for Jewes and Chriſtians, yet ſome particulars in it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of circumſtance either direct or indirect, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Jewes onely; as the preface to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment <hi>(I am the Lord which brought thee out of the

Now the new Covenant taking in<note n="ſ" place="margin">Iſai. 2.3. See Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> againſt <hi>Broad.</hi>
                  </note> Gentiles as well as Jewes, muſt neceſſarily vary theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials in the moral law, by conſtruing them in a new Covenant-ſenſe, to accommodate it to theſe new confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, as thus; by changing their temporal deliverance from <hi>Egypts</hi> thraldom, into out ſpiritual deliverance from the thraldom of ſin and Satan; the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> into any other part of the earth where the heirs of the promiſe ſhall dwell; their legal worſhip, into our Goſpel-worſhip; their gates, into our juriſdictions; in a word, their ſeventh day into our ſeventh day, which (analogically at leaſt) is as much intended by <hi>[ſeventh day]</hi> in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Canaan</hi> in the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If it be demanded, when, and by whom this change was introduced?

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115959:54"/>promiſes and the precepts of it: and the fore as the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> ſhortly after his reſurrection went to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> ſo Jeſus Chriſt after his, to <hi>Galilee;</hi> where (according to fore-appointment) he gave his diſciples a ſolemn meeting, and laid a ſolemn charge upon them, to teach the Gentiles to obſerve whatſoever he had commanded them. Now if the precept of the Sabbath were included among the reſt of thoſe commands (as 'tis like it was) it muſt be in ſuch a ſenſe as would comport with their new Covenant-ſtate; which muſt needs exclude the old ſeventh day, ſince that was a branch of the old Covenant peculiar to the Jews, and urged upon them by ſuch a reaſon or inforcement as in the letter of it concerned not the Gentiles at all, <hi>viz.</hi> their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 5.15. Myſtically indeed it concerned us as well as them (as implying out Redemption by Chriſt) but in that ſenſe it quite carries away the Sabbath from their old ſeventh day, in as much as the accompliſhment of our Redemption fell upon the firſt day of the week, <hi>viz.</hi> by the glorious reſurrection of our Saviour; but for which, we had remained ſtill in the <hi>Egypt</hi> of our<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17</note> ſins, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth.

Now if the proportion of one day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for holy reſt be holy, juſt, and good, it muſt needs be moral and perpetual, and ſo muſt the precept it ſelf that preſcribes it. But this proportion is holy, juſt, and good. Grant it to be juſt, and you cannot deny it to be holy; grant it good, and you cannot deny it to be juſt. Now let me reaſon the caſe with any religious ſoul, yea, with any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man; Is it not a point of moral equity to pay tribute out of all our times to the Lord of time, who holds our ſouls in life, and in whoſe hands both our times and our breath are? do we owe him a piece of every day, and ſhall we grudg him a day of every week? when he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ſix, can we in equity deny him one? Not that I take upon me to demonſtrate the equity of this number by the light of Nature, or to the light of Nature; for as I ſaid before, Nature is blind in theſe things; but I preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Nature and Reaſon informed by divine diſcovery, and acquainted with the written word. Surely ſuch as have read and pondered Gods liberal grant of ſix dayes to man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but yield his demand to be very reaſonable, requiring but one in ſeven for himſelf. Thus in reſpect of God. Again, in reſpect of Man; Is it not juſt and meet, that ſince Mans life upon earth is a pilgrimage, and he has no abiding City here, but looks for one above, therefore he ſhould not ſpend all his time, and thoughts and ſtudies about the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles of the world, but (as ſome time every day) ſo alſo ſome one day every week, retire from the world, and draw neer to God, to ſeek communion with him, with whom he looks to live for ever? Again, in reſpect of ſervants and cattel; is there not grand equity and reaſon that one day in a week they ſhould injoy ſome relaxation from their painſul ſervitude and bondage? that thy poor drudging ſervant eſpecially (who bears God image as well as thy ſelf) ſhould have a breathing-time, a day of weekly reſt for his wearied body, and one holy day in a week for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoul? Can we in equity afford them leſs? when
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115959:59"/>we have had ſix dayes ſervice from them, can we find in our wretched hearts to grudge the Lord one? True, you will ſay there is much equity in this, that ſome time in general ſhould be ſet apart for holy reſt; but what neceſſity of ſuch an exact proportion? why one day of ſeven more then one of ten, or two of ſeven? I anſwer as before; A natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity we do not pretend; but a Scriptural neceſſity there is why we ſhould be tyed to this proportion, and not to any other: and herein lies the moral and religious equity of it, as thus; The written word informs me that there are but four main diviſions of time, and theſe of Gods own making, <hi>viz.</hi> dayes, weeks, moneths, years, and I am convinced that Man cannot make perfecter diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of time then God himſelf hath made: ſince therefore there muſt be a time or ſeaſon of ſolemn worſhip, it muſt of neceſſity be taken out of one of theſe; it muſt be either a day out of a week, or a day or week out of a moneth, or a moneth out of a year; leſs then a day out of a week I cannot yield, ſince I cannot ſo much as pretend that <hi>leſt</hi> is ſufficient for God and my ſoul, when <hi>more</hi> may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be had. Again, a week out of a moneth, or a moneth out of a year, I cannot ſubſcribe unto as either convenient or equal,<note place="margin">See <hi>Iren. philal.</hi> u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Gods firſt diviſion of time was into dayes, and his firſt multiplication of dayes into weeks; and ever ſince his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect portion has been one day in the circle of every week. This was the conſtant tribute paid him under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament on the laſt day, and under the New Teſtament on the firſt day of the week: this therefore is moral and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, being of Gods own aſſignation, of the Churches conſtant obſervation, and in it ſelf the moſt exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115959:59"/>conſequently the Commandment in this reſpect muſt needs be moral: the rather, becauſe in all this there can beno ceremony; the number of ſeven is generally taken for a number of perfection, but who ere fancied it to be of a ceremonlous ſignification? What type or ceremony can there be imagined in ſeven more then in ſix? to make types of meer figures is ſuch a kind of Cabaliſm, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe never came into any ſober mind.

               <p>It followes not at all, unleſs you will ſay,<note place="margin">Reſol.</note> that thoſe particular Sacraments under the law [<hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeover</hi>] being ceremonial; make the like number of Sacraments under the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>] ceremonial too; the reaſon is alike in both, for the Ceremony ſtood not in the proportion or number, but in the particularity, or nature of that day and thoſe duties.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I have indeed granted,<note place="margin">Reſ.</note> that the Commandment did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly and occaſionally point at that preciſe ſeventh day, but not particularly, only within the general ſcope of it, or as a general rule equally communicable to that day (as being elſwhere appointed of God) while it ſtood; and to our day now it is ſubſtituted in the room of that by the ſame Divine appointment. And if this were heedfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the ſcruple were ſoon anſwered. But here lies the miſtake, men would fain ſcrue in the ſeventh day from that preſixed period of creation into the heart of the Commandment, and make that ſeventh day and a ſeventh day of equal dimenſions, which can never be, unleſs they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115959:60"/>will render the Commandment ceremonial; whereas to affirm, as I do, that the Commandment indirectly pointed at that day (as being then under Divine Sanction) does no more place a ceremony in the fourth Commandment, then it does in the fifth, to ſay, that by Father and Mother were meant not only natural, but civil and Eccleſiaſtical parents, and occaſionally ſuch as were Typical; as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prieſts and Levites, but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> alſo who were to be honoured by vertue of the fifth Commandment and that as Fathers in a figutative ſenſe: From which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thus much is manifeſt, that a moral precept may occaſionally point at ſomething ceremonial and yet retaine its own morality.

Some are jealous leſt in preſſing it ſo farr, it ſhould prove prejudicial to our week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian Sabbath; but this is meet cauſleſs jealouſly. For let us but pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſcope of the place, and it will appear, that the Apoſtles deſign is not to level Chriſtian dayes and duties, but ſuch as the Jewes obſerved, and would have intruded together with circumciſion and other legal rites into the Church of Chriſt. This is evident, [for he writes both
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115959:60"/>againſt diſtinctions of meats and dayes:] Now under that clauſe of <hi>[meats and drink]</hi> ſhall we ſay he condemns all diſtinctions of meats and drinks in matters of religion? What of bread and Wine in the Lords Supper too? or in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting againſt the Jewes Sacraments, eſpecially circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, does <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrike at all Sacraments, what bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and all? no, 'tis aparent that in all thoſe three Texts uſually alledged <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6 <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16. He cryes down the Ordinances of the Law, or old Teſtament not the inſtitutions of the Goſpel. Look what the Jewiſh falſ-teachers cryed up, St. <hi>Paul</hi> cryes down <hi>i. e.</hi> their Sabbaths and their Sacraments. 'Tis not likely that they ever pleaded for the Chriſtian Sabbath, (the firſt day of the week) and therefore tis moſt improbable that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in oppoſing them ſhould implead that. In a word,<note place="margin">Dies Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus non eſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae rerum futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum ſed rei praeterita, viz. glorioſae Chriſti reſurrectionis grata Recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. <hi>Brochmand.

                  </note> the Sabbaths here ſpecified were a ſhadow of things to come, whereas the Lords day (as one well obſerves) is only a memorial of ſomething paſt, to wit, the glorious reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. So that to argue from hence againſt all difference of dayes under the Goſpel (as the old Anabaptiſts and Familiſts do) is evidently to ſtretch the Text beyond the ſtapſe; But to urge it againſt all the Jewes Holy-dayes, (their weekly Sabbath and all) is not at all to force it. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle ſeemes to ſpeak diſtinctly, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively, enumerating the ſeveral ſorts of dayes in obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the Jewes, <hi>Holy-day, New moons, Sabbaths,</hi> and the gradation from yeerly <hi>holy-dayes,</hi> to monthly <hi>new Moons,</hi> and from them to weekly <hi>Sabbaths</hi> is viſible enough to ſuch as are not blinded with prejudice.

               <p>Secondly, The plural term <hi>[Sabbaths]</hi> is uſually put for the ſingular, the Sabbath or ſeventh day now under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.

For indeed the word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fignifies a feaſt, or feſtival day. Thus let Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture, and truth will be truth, in ſpight of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: take the whole ſentence together, <hi>holy-day, new Moon, Sabhaths,</hi> and (if it be an Old Teſtament-phraſe) it alwayes implies the old ſeventh day-Sabbath; or take the words <hi>[Sabbaths]</hi> ſingly by it ſelf, and (if it be a New Teſtament-term) as 'tis like it is) it ever (I think I may truely ſay <hi>ever</hi>) ſignifies the ſame ſeventh day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when it is put for the week, which here it cannot be. The concluſion then is undeniable, that the Jews ſeventh day Sabbath was a ſhadowy Sabbath, and therefore it cannot be our Chriſtian Sabbath, for what have we to do with ſhadowes under the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clear and bright diſcoveries of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> when we may with open face, as in a glaſs, behold the glory of the Lord. Oh, that the ſpirit of truth would take away that vail that lies upon the hearts of men, that vail of errour and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which keeps out the light of this truth; for a truth it is, a plain truth, as plain as Scripture can make it, that the Sabbaths here mentioned were a ſhadow of things to come; and I have made it evident, that the old Sabbath (as to the day) is here chiefly intended: it is not neceſſary that I ſhould trouble the Reader to tell him my judgment what kind of ſhadow it was, or what was ſhadowed by it in particular, whether Chriſts reſt that day full and whole
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115959:61"/>in the grave, or his reſt the next day from the grave, or a believers reſt in Chriſt a compleat Saviour: But this is certain, a ſhadow it was, of which ſomething in Chriſt was the body; and the body being come the ſhadow muſt be gone. And ſo I might proceed to another argument, but I muſt firſt remove ſome objections wherewith the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary has indeavoured to block up our way, But all in vain:</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>'tis evident at firſt ſight, that only ſuch Sabbaths are ceaſed as were ſhadows of good things to come; but the ſeventh day was never ſuch a Sabbath: A ſign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of good things paſt and preſent it was, but never term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſhadow of things to come.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Inaſmuch as the Ordinances of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were given by Angels, and by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a Typical Mediator; therefore in the two firſt ch. he ſets forth the excellency and dignity of Chriſt above Angels, proving him to be the very Son of God; and then ch. 3. he prefers him before <hi>Moſes;</hi> inaſmuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a Servant in Gods houſe, but Chriſt a Son, yea, the ownet and builder of the houſe; and ſuch a builder as made not only the little houſe) the Church,) but the great houſe (the world) alſo, ch. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4. therefore they had little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to return from Chriſt to <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Having thusprepared them, he fals upon his intended ſubject <hi>viz. A ſerious diſſwaſive from Apoſtacy:</hi> And becauſe they were about to caſt off the Solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the new Teſtament (for tis expreſly ſaid ch. 10. v. 25. <hi>That the manner of ſome was to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together</hi>) (which aſſemblies in the Churches of Chriſt were alwayes upon the firſt day of the week;) therefore to Preach down this ſin, among others, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle takes a Text out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95. and ſpends the beſt part of two chapters in the opening and applying of it.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115959:64"/>and calling upon one another to hear the voice of Chriſt, yea to come and worſhip before him; elſe how could the Apoſtle apply it to theſe Chriſtians? Further, <hi>oh.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 12. he adviſes them to <hi>take heed of an evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in departing from the living God, i. e.</hi> by forſaking his Ordinances and worſhip, and in particular his day of ſolemn worſhip, of which <hi>David</hi> here ſeemes to ſpea; leſt they ſhould provoke God by their Apoſtacy, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did by their infidelity; <hi>till he ſware againſt them in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt;</hi> whoſe ſin and puniſhment is further exemplified to the end of that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it might be thought that Gods oath did only concern the Iſraelites excluſion out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt informs us, that there was a Prophecy in that Hiſtory, and a promiſe in that Threatning. Therefore we are admoniſhed, ch. 4.1. <hi>To fear leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into reſt any of us ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> But how does the Apoſtle ground his admonition? What need Chriſtians fear? Yes good reaſon, for v. 2. <hi>To us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them.</hi> Therefore having the like priviledges we may expect the like puniſhment, if we pervert thoſe priviledges, or Apoſtatize from them through unbelief; for that was <hi>Iſraels</hi> undoing, <hi>the word Preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,</hi> v. 2. hence they fell ſhort of Gods reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a type of our eternal reſt in Heaven, into which none but believers do enter, <hi>v.</hi> 3.

               <p>Thus far we have traced the Apoſtles argument, and found it mainly tending to this, to caution theſe Hebrews againſt Apoſtacy, and againſt infidelity as the root of that Apoſtacy; againſt Apoſtacy I ſay, not from <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:115959:65"/>(fot they were<note n="*" place="margin">Acts. 21.20. They were all zealous of the law.</note> tenacious enough that way) but from Chriſt and his inſtitutions, and probably from the Chriſtian Sabbath, which ſome conceive to be the day pointed at by <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe they were apt to think that the day, and the reſt of which <hi>David</hi> ſpake, was the old ſeventh day, and the reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (which they were but too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to;) to root out this conceit, in the following verſes the Apoſtle removes theſe two ſuppoſed reſts, and plainly ſhews that neither the one nor the other could be intended either by <hi>David</hi> or himſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It could not be<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 35 2.</note> meant of the old ſeventh day (which is ſometimes ſtyled a Sabbath of reſt;) For <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the works were finiſhed from the foundation of the world, and God did reſt the ſeventh day from all his works; yet in this place again he ſaith, if they ſhall enter into my reſt,</hi> v. 4, 5. His argument ſtands thus; <hi>David</hi> expreſly mentions a day and a reſt to ſome (ſo much the word <hi>ſhall</hi> implies) <hi>[if they ſhall enter]</hi> but the reſt of the old ſeventh day was already entred into, three thouſand years before <hi>Davids</hi> time, even from the foundation of the world;<note place="margin">See dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> Comment. on the <hi>Hebr.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore that could not be this. The force of the argument lies in this; that things ſpoken of different times, whereof the one is of time paſt, the other of time to come, cannot be the ſame: for inſtance, that<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 34.24. &amp; ch. 37.25.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> who dyed many hundred years before Chriſt cannot be the ſame <hi>David</hi> who is promiſed to be a Prince amongſt Chriſtians. So here, the day, or reſt of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks being to come, and not then entred into, could not be the reſt of the old ſeventh day, ſince that was entred into long before, even from the foundation of the world. This is the true and genuine ſenſe of thoſe words <hi>[although]</hi> and <hi>[again.]</hi>
               </p>

                  </note>, or a note of diſtinction, importing thus much; that albeit there is mention made of a day of reſt in the beginning of the world, yet it is as another diſtinct day and reſt that is here intended. So
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115959:65"/>alſo this Adverb <hi>[again]</hi> is to be taken of another reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day then that which is mentioned in the former verſe; for although the old ſeveuth day were ſpoken of by <hi>Moſes</hi> as the firſt and moſt famons reſt in the beginning, yet now <hi>[again]</hi> ſo many thouſand years after that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks of another reſt, if not another reſt-day; and if any Sabbath or day of reſt be here intended either by <hi>David or Paul,</hi> it will certainly prove fatal to the old Sabbath: for I would humbly propoſe this quere to the conſideration of the learned, Whether the Pſalmiſts inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that there ſhould be a day of ſolemn worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel; and the Apoſtles aſſumption, that it could not be meant of the old ſeventh day, will not amount to this concluſion, that the old ſeventh-day-Sabbath is to be no day of reſt or ſolemn worſhip under the Goſpel. If <hi>T.T.</hi> quarrel at this concluſion, let him thank himſelf for the premiſes (one of them at leaſt;) for he grants a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſt or Sabbath to be here meant) and I will thank the Holy-Ghoſt and S. <hi>Paul</hi> for the other, for they have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me that the ſeventh day from the Creation could not be meant by <hi>David;</hi> no nor</p>
               <p>Secondly, The reſt of <hi>Canaan</hi> neither in the ſenſe above mentioned: for although that be ſometimes termed the<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 12.9. Joſh. 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>reſt</hi> which God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Joſhua;</hi> yet ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>If Jeſus had given them reſt,</hi> (that is, if he had given them the reſt of which <hi>David</hi> here ſpeaks,) <hi>then would he not afterward have ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day:</hi> where note by the way, tis a day of reſt which the Pſalmiſt ſeems to ſcope at, elſe why ſhould the Apoſtle thus interweave the one with the other, If <hi>Joſhuah</hi> or <hi>Jeſus</hi> had given them reſt then would he not afterwards have ſpoken of another day?</p>
               <p>Note again, the ſame Argument is here uſed againſt the ſuppoſed place of reſt that was urged before againſt their conceived time of reſt (the old ſeventh day;)
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115959:66"/>both theſe were entred into long before <hi>Davids</hi> time, whereas he ſpake by the ſpirit of prophecy concerning things to come a long time after: and hereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle concludes, <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt,</hi> or the keeping of a Sabbath <hi>to the people of God,</hi> diſtinct and different from the old Sabbath, yet not much unlike it in reſpect of the ground of it; for he that hath entred into his reſt hath ceaſed from his works, as God did from his own works. And this is ſpoken only of Chriſt, ſayes <hi>T.T.</hi> Be it ſo, then I hope our propoſition will not offend him, that when our bleſſed Lord Jeſus ended his work, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his reſt, he laid the foundation of a new Sabbath on that day of his reſt: only tis like this word [new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath] will ſtick in his ſtomach; yet it needs not, for we cannot put (the old Sabbath) into the Apoſtles conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe he himſelf puts it out of the premiſes. But we ſhall not wrangle about words; by new Sabbath I mean only a new Sabbath-day; and for peace-ſake I am content the propoſition ſhould paſs in theſe terms; The day on which Chriſt ended his works, and entred into his reſt, muſt be our Chriſtian Sabbath day. The aſſumption followes:</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Chriſt ended his work, and entred into his reſt, by his reſurrection from the dead on the firſt day of the week: for proof whereof we may proceed upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the Adverſaries Principles; for thus he argue; Chriſts entring into his reſt on the ſeventh day:<note place="margin">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115959:66"/>ſophiſter would make ſilly people believ: e) yet I ſhall take him at his word in the main of his argument, namely, that when our Saviour entred into his glory, he entred into his reſt: But I aſſume, By his reſurrection from the dead on the firſt day of the week our Lord entred into his glory; and for this I have his own word more then once or twice; in the 24 of <hi>Luke</hi> he overtakes the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and as they were talking together with ſad hearts about the ſufferings and the death of Chriſt, and alſo relating what they had heard (but could hardly believe) concerning his reſurrection, he takes them up with a ſharp rebuke,<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 24.25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken: Ought not Christ to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> to enter into his glory, you will ſay, that is to be underſtood of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention into Heaven; nay, verily he ſpake it of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, where their chief doubt lay; and ſo himſelf expounds it, for the ſame day at night he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the reſt of his Diſciples, and theſe among them, preaching the ſame Doctrine, and ſaying,<note n="c" place="margin">V. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day;</hi> this was that he had ſo often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated before his death,<note n="d" place="margin">Math. 16.21. ch. 17. 23.

If the glory of the ſtars be ſuch, what is the glory of the riſing Sun? But I muſt not expatiate here, a word more and I have done; <hi>He that hath entred into his reſt hath ceaſed from his works, as God did from his;</hi> whence I gather, that it is not only Chriſts reſt, but the reaſon of that reſt (the conſummation of the work of redemption) which occaſions our Sabbath; as Gods finiſhing the work of Creation did the old Sabbath, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.3 4. And this the word <hi>Reſt</hi> implies, being a demonſtrative proof of the accompliſhment of the work; for even a wiſe man, if
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115959:67"/>he undertake a work, will not reſt till it be finiſhed; or if he do, he is<note n="p" place="margin">Luke 14.29.30.</note> laugh'd at for his loſt labour: and therefore much more when the all-wiſe God is ſaid to reſt, may we conclude, his work is perfected. To ſpeak properly (if reſt imply only a ceſſation from work) we cannot ſay that God reſted from his work of Creation on the ſeventh day more then he has done ever ſince, or Chriſt from his work of redemption: therefore we muſt take in the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each work, as the ground of each reſt; otherwiſe all the time after ſhould be of equal account with the laſt day in reſpect of Creation, and with the firſt day in reſpect of Redemption: Now the queſtion will be, when the work of Redemption was conſummate and complete? Doubtleſs, not till the top-ſtone was laid, till Chriſt was made the head of the corner; which the<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 4.10, 11.</note> Apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us was by his reſurrection from the dead; for if this had not been done, the work had been all to do again: If Chriſt had ſuffered, dyed, and been ſwallowed up of death and corruption in the grave, and never riſen again, then had we remained ſtill in our ſins, and all our preaching of Chriſt, and faith in Chriſt had been vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. It was by our Saviours joyful reſurrection, therefore that the work of our Redemption was manifeſtly accompliſhed, and hereupon Chriſt reſted from his work, as God did from his: and as when God reſted from the work of Creation, he appointed a Sabbath, although he did not reſt from works of Providence; in like manner Chriſt hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Sabbath upon his reſting from the work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by price, although he doth not reſt from the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by power, till all his enemies by vanquiſhed, and all his elect ſaved, as a<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cheynels</hi> Treatiſe of the bleſſed Trinity. pag. 403.</note> learned Author ſpeaks.

               <p>To take the Apoſtles admonition as a caution againſt the neglect of the old Sabbath, is utterly to miſtake his main mark and ſcope: For his grand deſign is to prevent their Apoſtaſie from Chriſt and his Goſpel, not from <hi>Moſes</hi> and his law: And I am perſwaded, if any Sabbath-breaking be here intended, it is to deterre them from the breach of the Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>

How then did he reſt from the work of Redemption, as long as he lay under the arreſt of death in the priſon of the grave? Certainly all his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation work was Redemption-work from his Birth to his burial: and (ſetting aſide his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion) we have reaſon to think our Redeemer was not ſo much humbled all the three and thirty years of his life, as the three dayes and three nights after his death, while he lodged in the heart of the earth: Before he was but as the Sun in a cloud, but now as the Sun under a total E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe, as to the view of the world.

But to be ſure, whatever our bleſſed Redeemers reſt were before his Reſurrection, either that of his Soul in glory, or the other of his body in the grave, it could make nothing for the Saturday-Sabbath; for neither of theſe reſts were entred into on the ſeventh day, but both on the ſixth day.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115959:70"/>him to coine ſuch new Creeds, and preach ſuch new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, for ſear of the Apoſtles<note n="d" place="bottom">Gal. 1.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Anathema?</hi> To ſalve this he tells us <hi>p.</hi> 145. that our Saviours body was laid to reſt in the Sepulchre in the cloſe of the ſixth day. Very good!

But to conclude; this author has little reaſon to vaunt and glory (as he does) in this new invention: For, to make Chriſts reſt in the grave a ground of the weekly Sabbath, is neither proper in reſpect of the thing, nor proportionable in reſpect of the time. For the thing it ſelf, how altogether improper and incongruous is it, to keep a weekly feſtival in memory of our Saviours Funeral? to make that day a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing which was rather a day of mourning?

                  </note> Lords day as a day of ſpiritual joy and gladneſs, and ſpent the whole Saturday (the time of Chriſts lying in the grave) in Faſting and mourning; alledging, for their practiſe that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>When the Bride-groom is taken from them then ſhall they faſt, Luke</hi> 5.35. Again, it holds no proportion in reſpect of the time, for our Saviour lay three dayes and three nights in the grave; therefore this can be no pattern for a weekly Sabbath. I doubt the beſt of our new Sabbath-keepers would be weary of reſting ſo long at a time. But the ſtreſs of <hi>T.Ts.</hi> Argument is laid upon Chriſts entring into reſt, therefore there remaineth the keeping of a Sabbath to the people of God; and here I ſhall lay the ſtreſs of my anſwer, having manifeſtly proved that Chriſts entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reſt was not on the ſeventh day, no not in this authors
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115959:70"/>own new notion of reſt. And whereas he addes, that the taking down of our Saviours body from the Croſs, and laying it in the ſepulchre in the cloſe of the ſixth day, was providentially ordered: I anſwer, true, providentially indeed; for hereby the Holy Ghoſt has admirably provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt this future error of raiſing the old ſeventh-day-Sabbath from the dead, and building it up anew upon the grave of Chriſt, where it rather lies buried never to riſe again. For if the bleſſed body of Chriſt were laid in the grave on the ſixth day, then he entred not into that reſt, (nor indeed any reſt at all) on the ſeventh day. But on the firſt day of the week he entred into his true reſt, and ceaſed from his work of Redemption, as God the Father did the ſeventh day from his work of Creation; therefore there remaineth the keeping of a Sabbath to the people of God upon the day of Chriſts reſting from his work, the day of his riſing from the dead. And we have grand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that Chriſt had a ſignificant meaning in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing his Reſurrection to the third day, which was the firſt of the week; as the Father had in lengthening out the Creation to the ſeventh day, which was the laſt of the week. For as the Father could have created the world in a moment, ſo could the Son have quickned and raiſed himſelf from the grave aſſoon as he was in it, either the ſame day, or the ſeventh, if he had pleaſed: But he purpoſely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially paſſed over that day, and crowned the firſt of the week with the glory of his reſurrection; which plainly ſpeakes it his will and pleaſure to make that day the day of our weekly reſt, in which our Lord himſelf reſted from his greateſt work.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115959:71"/>into the Countrey.</hi> He means the diſciples going to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus, Luke</hi> 24.13, 14. This is his laſt refuge, and 'tis a very ſorry one. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, This travel was without labour; and if he had journeyed that day from earth to Heaven, and back again from Heaven to earth, it had been no impeachment to his holy reſt, any more then the motion of an Angel ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods errand would be a profanation of his Sabbath: certainly the body of Chriſt at his reſurrection was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, and able to move from earth to Heaven, as ſome think, in a moment.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115959:71"/>what I have here offered is in humility, and ſobriety of ſpirit, with ſubmiſſion to better and riper judgments. Let not this digreſſion be counted a tranſgreſſion; or if it be, pardon it. To return to my anſwer, this is moſt certain, that although the body of Chriſt after his reſurrection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a real and true body, yet it was a<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 24.37.</note> ſpiritual, a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and glorious body, free from that corpulency, that lumpiſhneſs, that ſubjection to wearineſs and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that theſe vile bodies of ours are clogged and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred withall; this is manifeſt by his marvellous apparitions upon earth, and his glorious<note n="i" place="margin">Acts 1.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.22.</note> aſſention into Heaven; when he mounted himſelf in the Chariot of that cloud, in which he rode in Triumph into glory; now motion is no hindrance to the reſt of a glorified body, ſuch as Chriſts was when he aroſe from the dead; therefore although he were in action and motion on the reſurrection day, yet he did not labour.</p>
               <p>His joyning with thoſe two Diſciples travelling to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> was a work of Charity and Piety. <label type="milestone">

But leaving the Adverſary to ſolace himſelf with theſe ſapleſs notions, and trifling objections; we proceed to a fourth Argument.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

How could it, if the bleſſings contained in it had bin nothing but Paradiſe bleſſings? But we ſhall not inculcate former arguments; only add one conſideration more to make it further manifeſt, that Gods reſt on the ſeventh day was partly (if not chiefly) in relation to Chriſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah. Tis a ſaying of the Hebrew Doctors, and it agrees well with the<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 2.10.

                  <hi>heir</hi> of all things and that as Mediatour; and we have reaſon to think, that Gods heart were more ſet upon Chriſt when he ſet up this viſible frame of Heaven and earth, then upon all the world beſides. How unlikely therefore is it that the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creator ſhould ſet apart a day of reſt, till the grand deſign upon which his thoughts had run from all eternity, and which was chiefly in his eye when he made the world, (the glorifying of himſelf in his Son, by inveſting him with the government of the world, and putting him as heir of all things into actuall poſſeſſion of his hereditary
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115959:75"/>Dominions) had ſome actual inchoate exiſtence? 'Tis cleare, that God did not reſt from his other works of Creation till he had made man; becauſe till then he had not attained his ſubordinate end of making the reſt of his creatures: and tis credible, that he would not reſt, after he had made man, till he had made Chriſt Mediatour, and put the government of all upon his ſhoulders; becauſe till then he had not attained his ultimate end, for which he made man and all the reſt of the world beſides. Certain it is, that the Creation was made but mutably perfect at firſt and therefore it cannot be conceived how God could keep a ſetled reſt the ſeventh day, till he had ſetled and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed the Creation on Chriſt the rock,<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 32.4.</note> whoſe work is perfect: And this I conceive to be the true and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe of that ſaying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>On the ſeventh day God ended,</hi> Finiſhed, or perfected, <hi>his work;</hi> namely, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing it upon Chriſt that ſure foundation;<note place="margin">1 Peter 4.18.</note> hence he is ſtyled <hi>a faithfull Creator,</hi> in that he did not leave his work of Creation in a mutable eſtate (as Maſons and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters when they have built their houſes leave them without any further care what becomes of them) but as a faithful Creator<note n="*" place="margin">God was not the author or approver of mans falbut on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the orderer and over ruler of it to bring good out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</note> he over ruled the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> for a greater good, namely for the eſtabliſhment of his mutable work, by bringing in Chriſt the right heir, ſetting him as<note n="e" place="margin">Pſ. 8.6.

Not ſtrictly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically for every vowel, point and prick of a letter in the Law; but for the ſubſtance and leaſt matter of it, the leaſt Commandment in it; ſo our Saviour expounds himſelf, Matth. 5.19. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments and teach men ſo, ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of God;</hi> teaching us, that by [<hi>jot</hi> or <hi>tittle of the Law</hi> verſe 18.] he meant the leaſt Commandment of the Moral Law <hi>v.</hi> 19. Thus alſo St. <hi>James</hi> ch. 2.10. <hi>He that ſhall offend in one point is guilty of all.</hi> By one point he means any one precept or Commandment in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. He explains himſelf by the reaſon rendred verſe 11. <hi>For he that ſaid, Do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Do not kill:</hi> As if he had ſaid, the ſame God that gave one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment gave all, therefore when any one point or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is violated, the contempt reflects upon the whole Law, the leaſt ſin being an affront to Gods ſoveraignty. So then the ſenſe of both places is the ſame; the leaſt point or precept of the Moral Law is in force under the Goſpel; and if the leaſt, much more the fourth Commandment, which indeed is none of the leaſt. But what of all this? The fourth Commandment is eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, therefore the ſeventh day in weekly ſucceſſion from the Creation; the Conſequence is infirm. For that day was never directly ſtated in the Commandment; the fourth Commmandement ſayes not, Thou ſhalt keep holy the laſt day of the week, and not the firſt, but <hi>a ſeventh day</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or <hi>one</hi> in ſeven: the old ſeventh day may be and is repealed; and yet the Commandement ratyfied to a tittle in the matter; yea in the very letter of it evangelically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; to wit, as it is explained by Chriſt according to the will of God, though not the carnal reaſonings of men.

He was Lord of both while they laſted, that he might diſſolve both when their ſeaſon was expired, that he might legally and <hi>ex officio</hi> give his people a diſcharge from both. As for the Authors crafty collation of theſe two expreſſions <hi>[Lord of the Sabbath day]</hi> and <hi>[Lords Supper]</hi> whereby he would inſinuate the equall authority and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of that Legal Sabbath with this Evangelical Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſavours of more ſophiſtry then ſolidity of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: let the unlearned know, that as the terms are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the Greek, ſo the phraſe in our Engliſh Dialect imports different things; 'tis one thing to call Chriſt Lord of this or that, another thing to ſay tis the Lords; to ſay he was Lord of the Sabbath, and that before his death, is nothing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115959:77"/>ſo much as to to ſay, this is the Lords Supper, and that after his reſurrection; The former imports the office or authority of Chriſt, the latter implyes his Ordinance: And let the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector know, that this Epithet [<gap reason="foreign">

The diſciples through the Phariſaical carping and miſpriſion of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, were condemned for Sabbath-breaking, becauſe they had pluck'd a few eares of corne and dreſſed them for their dinner on the Sabbath day, which was a work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pure neceſſity (hunger and emptineſs conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to it) and ſo no breach of the Sabbath.<note place="margin">Hoſpin. de orig.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115959:78"/>of the Meſſiah; therefore the Son of man is alſo Lord of the Sabbath day; That is, it falls under my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and diſpoſal as the Son of man: The phraſe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, he ſayes not <hi>The Son of</hi> David, but, <hi>The Son of man;</hi> the Mediator pointed out in the promiſe made to <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man; even he is Lord of the Sabbath day, or has dominion over it, being at firſt the foundation of it. This is the moſt probable interpretation, if we take the Son of man here for Chriſt.

                  <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath day.</hi> I have two things to anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of ſuppoſition: ſuppoſing it were meant of the Jewes Sabbath, it would ſignifie no more but this, that it would be ſuperſtitiouſly kept among the unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jewes forty yeares after our Saviours death, (as it is to this day) and therefore pray that your flight may not be either in the winter, when it will be doleful dirty; or on the Sabbath, when it will be dangerous travelling
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115959:78"/>through the coaſts of <hi>Judea,</hi> and bring you into peril of perſecution by your own countrey-men, which was one of <hi>Pauls</hi> perils 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. For although by that time the diſciples were ſufficiently inſtructed in their Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that their flight was as lawfull on that day as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore they could not flye with ſcruple of conſcience, yet the ſuperſtitious Jewes (to whom ſuch flight might be offenſive) in all reaſon would <hi>Shimei</hi>-like, barke at ſuch harmleſs paſſengers, if not bite and ſnap them. And whereas it is objected,<note place="margin">T.T. p. <hi>78.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That it cannot be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conceived, that the Jewes instead of ſecuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould trifle away their time in perſecuting the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> This objection is anſwered by himſelf in the very next words almoſt: <hi>For,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the Jewes were ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious that they durſt not fight for their life;</hi> Then I may well inferre, that tis moſt likely they were alſo ſo zealous that they would perſecute any who ſhould flye for their life, if they themſelves would rather dye then flye, or fight for their lives (as he ſuggeſts) much more would they hinder the flight of others. So that if the old Sabbath were intended by our Saviour, it was rather with a note of diſlike then approbation; as foreſeeing that through the ſuperſtition of the Jewes it would be an occaſion of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to his ſervants, as it had often been to himſelf. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I ſay (for I grant it not) that the Jewes Sabbath was here meant, it muſt be conſtrued in ſuch a ſenſe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are counſelled to deprecate their flight on that day for the better avoiding of bodily calamities; for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that day we cannot ſo much as ſuppoſe any ſoule diſtreſs incident to the diſciples by reaſon of ſuch flight; we cannot conceive how they ſhould be ſtraightned in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence out of any religious reſpect to that day at the ſiege or ſacking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſince the adverſary himſelf confeſſes, <hi>That all ceremonies were then aboliſhed by Apoſtolical procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> For which he cites <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. Which Text does irrefragably prove the repeale of the old Sabbath, as was ſaid before. And thus he is caught in his own trap. But</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:115959:79"/>
               <p n="2">2. By way of affirmation, I aſſert, That theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour <hi>(pray that your flight be not on the Sabbath)</hi> are to be underſtood of our Chriſtian Sabbath, the firſt day of the week; not directly indeed, but by very good conſequence, as Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly argue it. For (ſayes the one) our Saviour does here ſpeak of a Sabbath indefinitely, and a Sabbath to be obſerved long after his death, even at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and this was ſpoken to his diſciples apart from the multitude, ſayes the other <hi>v.</hi> 3. and the period of time here pointed at was forty years after his death, when the Jewiſh Sabbath was gone, and the Goſpel ſufficiently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, whereby the ceremonial Law was evacuated, and become not only dead but deadly. Not that the old Law of a Sabbath (the fourth Commandment) was then out of force, but the Law of the old Sabbath. And then the concluſion is this, Chriſt ſhewes a Sabbath to continue and a religious reſpect due to a Sabbath ſtill after his death; yet not the Jewes Sabbath, therefore he intended the Chriſtian Sabbath to be obſerved according to the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for the Jewes Sabbath tis certain, that it was void at this point of time; yea long before this forewarned flight, the Apoſtles and Chriſtians had their aſſemblies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the other Jewes, and kept the Lords day, the firſt day of the week; as on the Great day of <hi>Pentecoſt, Acts</hi> 2. and at <hi>Troas Acts</hi> 20.7. And although ſometimes the Apoſtles did preach on the ſeventh day, yet as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> notes, it was only before the time mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 20 never after, and only in other Cities abroad, not at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for there we never read a word of the Sabbath in all the ſtory of the Acts. I conclude therefore, with that reverend Author, that no reaſon can be given why our Saviour in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical caution ſhould regard the Jewiſh Sabbath, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the contrary, in regard the Chriſtians inhabiting in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Coaſts about <hi>Judea</hi> preferred the Lords day before it; and it would be grievous to gracious hearts to have their holy reſt interrupted with the noiſe of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115959:79"/>warlike tumults, and the hurry of a tumultuous flight; well might the diſciples be taught to pray, Lord, when ever we be driven from the place of our Reſidence, let it not be on a day of holy reſt, for that would be as uncomfortable to our ſouls as a winters flight would be cumberſome to our bodies? Not that it would be ſinful or unlawful (when life lay at ſtake) to flye on the Sabbath; for to ſave a mans life is a Sabbath-dayes duty, and a matter of far greater moment then to leade a beaſt to the water, or pull an oxe out of a pit, both which are allowable: it may therefore be ſcored down among the reſt of <hi>T.T's.</hi> errors and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, that he makes it a ſin to flye on the Sabbath day, when peril of life puts a man upon it, for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But for a cloſure to this anſwer, we have deliberately weighed our Saviours words and ſayings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sabbath, but cannot find that ever he ſpake one word or one ſyllable, in countenance of the old ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as the Sabbath of Chriſtians; his words prove no ſuch thing. And laſtly</p>
               <p>Whereas his workes are pleaded as the crown of that day, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> I am content (if the author think good) to venture the whole weight of the cauſe in this bottom.

If Chriſts reſurrection, his often apparitions, the miſſion of his Spirit, the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Apoſtles, the converſion of three thouſand ſouls ot once, be worthy the name of wonders, ſurely the firſt day of the week is a day of wonder, a day of honor and renown above all the dayes that ever the Sun ſhone
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115959:80"/>upon: The moſt glorious day that ever God created, the moſt ſolemn day that ever the Church celebrated; a day that has crowned Chriſt, and a day that Chriſt himſelf has crowned with the greateſt glory of any day that ever daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the world.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> I ſpeak but the words of truth and ſoberneſs;<note place="margin">Luke 13.32.

Let prophane <hi>Eſaus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, and proud Notioniſts oppoſe it at their peril;<note place="margin">Behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> with the crown wherewith his mother crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the day of his eſpouſals and in the day of the gladneſs of his heart; never was Chriſt more viſibly Crowned by his Church then on the Lords day, which alſo was the day of his eſpouſals when he was made ſure to his Church by a ſure Covenant, even the ſure mercies of David Hoſ. 2.19, 20. Acts 13.34.</note> but let neither of them blame me, if I honor and eſteem it above all dayes, till they can ſhew me another day which the Saviour of the world has honored and exalted above it. Never tell me of one or two miracles wrought on the ſeventh day (yet I deſire to adore Chriſt in all his miracles) but ſhew me ſuch a confluence of wonders and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful tranſactions wrought by him whoſe name is wonderful on that day, as on this, and I will confeſs I have loſt the day. Alas! It cannot be, that one tranſcendent act (the Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus from the dead, the finiſhing act of our Redemption) weighs down all the honor of the ſeventh day, with advantage; 'Tis objected, that our Saviour was pleaſed to put forth his Divine vertue on the ſeventh day in ſundry miracles, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of healing and the like; I anſwer, 'Tis very true, and to him be all the glory. But if it were an honor to that day that our Heavenly phyſitian healed the ſick, what a Crown of glory was it to his own day, that he raiſed the dead? Yea that being dead he raiſed himſelf from the dead? ſo alſo if he dignified the ſeventh day by caſting out unclean Spirits; how much more the firſt day by ſending his holy Spirit? If his preaching in the Synagogues were an honor to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115959:80"/>day; how much more his preſenting himſelf, in that great Aſſembly of Divines twice (at leaſt) on the firſt day of the week? Did Chriſt ever riſe from the dead on the ſeventh day? Did he ever appear to his diſciples on that day? Did he breath forth the bleſſed Spirit on that day? Did he ever preach a Sermon (after his Reſurrection) on that day? But I need go no further; here is light enough if men had but eyes; I hope by this time the Objector ſees the invalidity of his ſecond Argument; that which he calls the Sons confirmation. He proceeds to a third, from the Spirits approbation of the ſeventh day.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115959:81"/>for the ſeventh day, is from the Saints obſervation; which runs chiefly upon the practice of <hi>Paul;</hi> it would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to tranſcribe his whole ſtory. Take the ſtrength of it as it follower in this plauſible Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As it was Chriſts conſtant cuſtome to celebrate the ſeventh day Sabbath</hi> Luke 4.18. <hi>So it was</hi> Pauls Acts 172. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>and ſuch as his cuſtome was, ſuch was his commiſſion: and we must be followers of</hi> Paul <hi>as he was of Chriſt</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. <hi>tis his own rule,</hi> Philip. 4.9. Thoſe things which ye have both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, do; <hi>Only it muſt be underſtood with theſe limitations, that</hi> Pauls <hi>practice be plain, poſſible, peaceable, Evangelicall and unrepealed; for we may not follow</hi> Paul <hi>in his compliance with the Jewes in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonials, no not to gain the Jewes. But his practice in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeventh day was truly Evangelical, and never in the leaſt tittle repealed, nor altered; neither was it his ſingle practice, but the cuſtome of all his companions and aſſociates</hi> Acts 13.13, 14. ch. 15.40.16, 13, 17, 24. <hi>And that not only among the Jewes but the Gentiles alſo</hi> Acts 13.42. ch. 18.4. <hi>Therefore he did it not to pleaſe the Jewes, but purpoſely for a pattern to the Gentiles: Hence he exhorts the Corinthians (Gentile Churches) to follow him as he followed Chriſt; and it was at</hi> Corinth <hi>that he kept the Sabbath</hi> Acts 18. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was the pattern wherein he would have them be his followers, and us alſo, for the Epiſtle is written to us as well as to them,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. Thus he pleads <hi>Pauls</hi> cuſtome, and addes, <hi>It was his conſtant cuſtome; and whereas</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>it is made a great Argument for the obſervation of the firſt day, that</hi> Paul <hi>preached once that day</hi> Acts 20.7. <hi>it is as clear</hi> Paul <hi>preached every Sabbath-day</hi> Acts 18.4. <hi>Only the Tranſlators have not dealt ſo clearly</hi> (upon which account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others he charges them with <hi>ſin</hi> yea with inexcuſeable ſin, <hi>p.</hi> 139.) <hi>becauſe</hi> Acts 20.7. <hi>they render the word</hi> (preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>for the greater advancement of the firſt day, whereas</hi> Acts 18.4. <hi>they call it</hi> (reaſoning) <hi>to obſcure the ſeventh day, although the Greek word be the ſame in both places.</hi> Then he frames an objection againſt himſelf (which he can never an ſwer)</p>

               <p>

               <p>The propoſition upon which he argues (<hi>that we muſt follow</hi> Paul <hi>as he followed Chriſt</hi>) is true in a Scripture ſenſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>1</label> but his expoſition and application of it is falſe; for if he take <hi>Pauls</hi> following of Chriſt <hi>materially,</hi> for his doing the ſame things that Chriſt did (as it ſeems he does) and then argue univerſally from it (as he muſt if he will make any thing of it) his concluſion will contradict himſelf; for he has granted ſome exempt caſes wherein <hi>Pauls</hi> practice does not bind us, and yet his practice therein was materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſame with Chriſts; and I will give him ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to put it out of queſtion, that in ſome caſes <hi>Paul</hi> did what Chriſt did, and yet we are not bound to do as <hi>Paul</hi> did.<note place="margin">Luke 2.42. John 2.13 ch. 5.1. ch. 7.10.</note> For example, our Saviour Chriſt uſed at the ſolemn feſtivals of the Jewes to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as at the feaſt of Paſſeover, Pentecoſt and the reſt) and <hi>Paul</hi> did the like; He haſted to be at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt,<note place="margin">Acts 18.21. ch. 20.16.</note> and <hi>I muſt by all means</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>keep this feaſt that cometh in Jeruſalem.</hi> So that, if to practice the ſame things in any kind that Chriſt did, be to follow Chriſt, herein <hi>Paul</hi> was a follower of Chriſt; yet I hope it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not that herein we muſt be followers of <hi>Paul,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he would have us all turn Jewes. The like I may ſay concerning the Jewes Sabbath: if he object againſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, and ſay it will not hold, becauſe thoſe other Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals are repealed, but ſo is not the ſeventh day: I reply, let him ſhew me a repeal for the one, and I ſuppoſe I can ſhew him as good a repeal for the other. His grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, That the ſeventh day was never expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115959:82"/>I anſwer no more was Pentecoſt: Where does the Holy Ghoſt ſay in expreſſe termes, Pentecoſt is abrogated: if he ſay it is included among the reſt of thoſe holidayes <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. I will ask him, how can he tell that, as long as it is not expreſly named? If he ſay it is implyed, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſo is the ſeventh day, and then we are agreed. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be objected againſt this anſwer, for the inſtance I have given is plain and pertinent. And although I am fully convinced that Pentecoſt is abrogated as well as the Saturday Sabbath (and that as well as this) yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded if a man liſted to be contentious, he might make as much ado about the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, and have as much to ſay for it from the practice of the Apoſtle, as can be ſaid for the Saturday Sabbath, yea more; for whoever heard St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay of the Sabbath, as he ſayes of Pentecoſt, <hi>I muſt needs keep the Feaſt?</hi> If he had ſaid as much of the ſeventh day I ſhould have thought he had made conſcience of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which doubtleſs he did not, or he would never have omitted it at <hi>Troas,</hi> as it ſeems he did <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. where he tarried ſeven dayes, and not a ſyllable of keeping the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day; but the firſt day of the week.</p>
               <p>But ſayes the Objector, it was Chriſts cuſtome to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the ſeventh day Sabbath, and ſo it was <hi>Pauls. Chriſt as his cuſtome was went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day</hi> Luke 4.16. And <hi>Paul</hi> as his manner was did the ſame thing. Chriſts cuſtom herein was the very ſame with <hi>Pauls.

                  <note place="margin">Tis not ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their Sabbaths; but he went into their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with them three Sabbaths.</note> If we ſhould grant him his Argument he would get nothing by it. For it makes as much for the Jewes Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues as the Jewes Sabbath. And what would follow from hence? Suppoſe there were a Synagogue of the Jewes in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> as there is at <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> will he ſay that Chriſtians are bound in conſcience to frequent it becauſe Chriſt as his cuſtome, and <hi>Paul</hi> as his manner was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Synagogues? If <hi>Paul</hi> did it from a principle of conſcience, or obedience to the Law, as Chriſt did, I ſee not how he can avoid it; but if <hi>Paul</hi> did it only in a way of Chriſtian prudence, to win the Jewes, he has loſt his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115959:83"/>Argument; for the like I ſay of the Sabbath.</p>

Purely Evangelical, and never yet repealed, therefore he muſt eat his words or yield his cauſe. As for the old ſeventh day it was both legal (according to his principles, it muſt be an appendix to the Covenant of works being inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, when there was no Goſpel, therefore purely legal) and according to my principles, partly legal (as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was) therefore repealed among the reſt of thoſe legal dayes of worſhip: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. for though he cannot read the repeal there, yet through mercy I and others can.

Neither is it to ſpeak without book, as we ſhewed above; nor does it charge Chriſt with any criminal imputation; he kept the Sabbath (while it was in force) from a principle of conſcience, in obedience to the Law, <hi>Paul</hi> from a principle of Chriſtian prudence and indulgence, the better to promote the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and ſo his cuſtom was not formally the ſame with Chriſts, neither does his cuſtom argue his commiſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in things Moral and Evangelical, and among the Gentiles,<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 11.13. ch. 15.16.

So that (all objections to the contrary notwithſtanding) it remains a firm and immoveable truth of God, that the old ſeventh day is diſcharged, from being a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or day of weekly ſolemn worſhip to the people of God.</p>
               <p>Now by way of Tranſition to the ſecond branch of my Argument <hi>[that the firſt day of the week is deſigned for a day of weekly ſolemn worſhip under the Goſpell]</hi> I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the Reader of what was premiſed and proved before; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law of the fourth Commandment (for the proportion, of ſix working dayes, and a ſeventh every week for ſolemn worſhip, ordinarily) is ſtill in force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. Which being made good, and the old ſeventh day manifeſted to be void, one Argument will put it out of all queſtion, that the firſt day of the week, is the only day of weekly worſhip to be obſerved under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. As thus:</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:115959:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That day of the week upon which above all others (in the vacancy of the old ſeventh day) God has ſet his mind in the Law; and upon which, above all other dayes Chriſt has ſet his mark in the Goſpel, muſt needs be the Chriſtians weekly day of ſolemn worſhip, or Sabbath day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the firſt day of the week (the old ſeventh day being void) is the day above all others in the week upon which God has ſet his mind in the Law; and upon which above all other dayes, Chriſt has ſet his mark in the Goſpel:</hi> Therefore, <hi>The firſt day of the week muſt needs be the Chriſtians weekly day of ſolemn worſhip or Sabbath day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The propoſition is undeniable; for what better warrant can be pretended for a weekly Sabbath, then Gods <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>will</hi> in the <hi>Law</hi> and Chriſt <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aſſumption is all that requires proof, namely, <hi>[That the ſeventh day being void, the firſt day of the week is the day above all others upon which God has ſet his mind in the Law, and Chriſt his mark, his ſignal mark in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel]</hi> Both which ſhall be diſtinctly and demonſtratively proved, by Scripture-conſequence and evidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That (the ſeventh or last day of the week being void, as we have proved) the firſt day of the week is the only day, upon which it appears that God has ſet his mind in the Law;</hi> I mean, the Law of the fourth Commandment, which may be thus made out. It was the mind and pleaſure of God, that the proportion ſtated in the Commandment, (<hi>ſix</hi> dayes in the week for civil imployment, and <hi>one</hi> for ſacred and religious reſt) ſhould be obſerved in all ages,<note place="margin">Exod. 35.2. Ezek. 46.1. See Mr. <hi>Gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey p.</hi> 1. ch. 9. <hi>S.</hi> 53. and part 3. ch. 3.</note> both under the Law, and under the Goſpel. Now the ſeventh day which was obſerved under the Law, being diſcharged; there is no other day but the firſt day of the week on which Gods proportion can be preſerved and perpetuated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion and interruption. <q>[For take any other day, as the ſecond, or third, or fifth, or ſixth, and there would be loſſe of time; it would not be (for once at leaſt) one day in ſeven, but one of ſome other number; and beſides, the ſix working dayes would not come all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115959:86"/>but ſome of them would go before the day of reſt, and others would come after it, in one and the ſame week. Both which would offer violence to the Holy Commandment, which as it requires but one day in a week for religion, to ſix for worldly buſineſſe, and allots ſix for worldly buſineſs to one for religion or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily; ſo it takes order that the ſix working dayes muſt go together, and the day of reſt not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the ſame week, but either go before, or follow them. Now in pitching upon the firſt day of the week both theſe were punctually obſerved at the firſt change of the day; for in the revolution of twice ſeven dayes there were two dayes for religion, the laſt of the firſt ſeven, and the firſt of the latter ſeven; and in each revolution the ſix working dayes are all together].</q> And thus it is ſtill ſucceſſively week after week; and thus it ſhall be perpetually (I queſtion not) to the laſt week of the world; for I am aſſured that the old ſeventh day is void, and I am fully convinced that (whatever the Lord Chriſt could have done) we cannot make choice of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weekly day of worſhip, but the firſt of the week, to hold up the morality of the fourth Commandment; which as the above mentioned Author (at whoſe torch I have light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my candle) obſerves, is a thing worthy of ſpecial note, any may afford a ſatisfying reaſon, why there is no expreſſe inſtitution of the firſt day of the week in the new Teſtament <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the vertue of the fourth Commandment doth of it ſelf fall upon that day, the former being void, being the only day capable of keeping up Gods proportion perpetually determined in the Commandment; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (as formerly) that the Commandment does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly inſtitute the day, but falls upon the obſervation of it, and ſuppoſes the inſtitution; neither do I urge it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for the deſignation of the day; for the firſt day of the week is not expreſly mentioned in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (no more is the laſt day of the week neither) (but <hi>a</hi> ſeventh day is; which although (as I ſaid before) it could
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115959:87"/>not be reſtrained to one day more then another; yet my meaning was, and is, that it could not be ſo tyed to the laſt of ſeven, as not to be applyed to the firſt of ſeven, if God ſo pleaſed. Briefly, this argument concludes rather for the obſervation, than the deſignation of the firſt day day of the week, as the only day upon which (in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the old Sabbath) God has ſet his mind in the Law. And good reaſon. For</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the day, upon which, above all other dayes Chriſt has ſet his <hi>mark,</hi> his ſpecial, ſignall, characteriſtical mark in the Goſpel, to mark it out for a day of weekly ſolemn worſhip under the new Teſtament. A ſeven-fold mark he has ſet upon it, which the malice of men and divels ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to obliterate. As</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115959:87"/>he boldly tells them, <hi>This is the ſtone which ye buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refuſed; which is become the head of the corner;</hi> he ſpeaks it of Chriſt and of Chriſts reſurrection; for <hi>v.</hi> 10. he had ſpoken of their refuſing him in his Crucifixion, and Gods exalting him in his reſurrection. <hi>Whom ye crucified and whom God raiſed from the dead.</hi> Thereby making him both a corner-ſtone, and head of the corner; <hi>Head of all principality and power.

Thus of Davids prophetical prediction. Next let us conſider his application of it; 1. In reſpect of the <hi>deed</hi> done; 2. In reſpect of the <hi>day</hi> on which it was done. 3. In reſpect of the <hi>duty</hi> of that day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The deed or work done (the raiſing of Chriſt from the dead) he magnifies as the Lords own act, his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtupendious act; <hi>This is the Lords doing and it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our eyes, v.</hi> 23.

                  <note place="margin">Acts 13.41.</note> Sayes the Apoſtle; wonder, at what? Why at Gods raiſing Chriſt from the dead, of which he had treated before, <hi>verſe</hi> 36, 37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pſalmiſt applies it further to the <hi>day</hi> on which this work of wonder was wrought. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made;</hi> and mark the connection, the day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the deed or work done. <hi>Factum domini</hi> (as one ſayes) <hi>facit diem domini.</hi> The Lords deed makes it the Lords day: Here the inſtitution of the day is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115959:88"/>founded upon the reſurrection of Chriſt; upon this account 'tis ſtiled the day which the Lord hath made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtone, caſt aſide of the builders (Chriſt crucifyed) was made the head of the corner; that is, raiſed from the dead, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> expounds, and as Chriſts reſurrection was the Lords own doing, ſo the Pſalmiſt foreſaw that the reſurrection-day would be a day of the Lords own making. If it be objected, So is every day. I anſwer but not every day alike. For look as it was in the works of Creation, all were Gods works, all of his making; but man (the maſter-piece) more eſpecially, of whom it may be ſaid with an accent, this is the creature which God had made; ſo here, all the dayes in the week are of Gods making, but this in the Text above all; the Holy Ghoſt ſets an Emphaſis upon it, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made:</hi> Made 1 How made? not by was of Creation, ſo 'twas made before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. But by way of inſtitution; <hi>The day which the Lord hath made.</hi> What has he made it? A working-day, ſo it was before, if therefore he has made it any thing, it muſt be a holy ſolemn day, a day more ſolemn and ſacred then all the dayes that God ever made before. And ſo the word ſignifies, not only to makes but to magnify, 'tis equivalent to <hi>ſanctifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Pſalmiſt proceeds to the prophetical delineation of the <hi>duties</hi> of this day, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce therein;</hi> Yea he brings in the Church ſhouting and ſinging Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's to Chriſt on this day, <hi>v.</hi> 26.<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 21.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh to us in the Name of the Lord:</hi> As when the<note n="b" place="margin">Zech. 4.7.</note> Temple was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the head-ſtone was brought forth with ſhouting, crying grace, grace, thereunto. So here, when the work of our redemption ſhould be finiſhed, and Chriſt exalted as head and corner-ſtone of his Church by his triumphant Reſurrection, the Holy Ghoſt intimates the ſolemn gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, and publick praiſe that the Church ſhould offer on that day. So we are to underſtand the next words, were (as<note n="c" place="margin">Iſal 56.7. Mal. 1.11.</note> uſually) New Teſtament-worſhip is ſet forth in an old Teſtament-dreſs, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>God is the Lord which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115959:88"/>hath ſhe wed us light,</hi> (light indeed when the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ariſes) he has made it a day of light and gladneſs to poor ſelf-condemned ſinners; therefore <hi>bind ye the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with cords to the horns of the altar:</hi> That is, offer to the Lord the ſacrifice of publick praiſe and thankſgiving, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Oh give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, his mercy endureth for ever!</hi> So that, tis evident, a day of ſolemn worſhip is here intended, and Chriſts reſurrection day is principally pointed at, as a day which the Lord would inſtitute and a day which the Church ſhould cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate; Saying, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us be gland and rejoyce therein.</hi> What a plain Scripture-proof is this of Divine authority of the Lords day? So plain that the adverſary is forced to grant it.<note place="margin">page <hi>61.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>It muſt needs be meant of Chriſts reſurrection-day,</hi> ſaies he; and when he wrote his firſt book, he excited Chriſtians to the weekly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of it: Whereas in a late railing pamphlet ſince he ſeekes to ſmother the light and evidence of this Text by a ſilly evaſion, that the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks not of every firſt day of the week, but Eaſter-day, as may be conjectured. But I ſhall eaſily ſhake off this ſlight exception. Away with conjectures, let us ſearch the Scriptures; what day does the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture call Chriſts reſurrection-day? Ask <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> they'l tell you,<note place="margin">Math. 28.1. Mark 6.2. Luke 24.1. John 20.1, 19.</note> tis the firſt day of the week; the day of the year is never mentioned, nor the day of the month on which Chriſt aroſe, but the day of the week only, to teach us doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that Chriſts reſurrection-day muſt be no yearly, or monthly, but a weekly ſolemnity. Good reaſon, that the work of Redemption ſhould have as frequent a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, as the work of Creation had. Now ponder this, good Reader; and the Lord print it upon thy heart; the day of the Saviours Reſurrection prophetically extolled in the old Teſtament, as the day which the Lord hath made, is hiſtorically noted down in the New Teſtament as the firſt day of the week; and now we ſhall draw an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I hope will be an arrow of conviction to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115959:89"/>contrary-minded, the rather becauſe it comes out of Gods own quiver; thus the day of Chriſts reſurrection is the day which he Lord hath made for duties of ſolemn worship; but the firſt day of the week is the day of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; therefore the firſt day of the week is the day, which the Lord hath made for duties of ſolemn worſhip. The propoſition is warranted by the Teſtimony of the Pſalmiſt, the aſſumption is confirmed by the harmony of all the four Evangeliſts, the concluſion therefore will ſtand, as long as the world ſtands; namely, that the firſt day of the week is a day of divine inſtitution; mark'd out by the finger of God, the ſpirit of Chriſt for a day of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn weekly worſhip under the Goſpel. For, as I hinted before, the teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophecy.<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1.16. 2 Tim. 3.16. 1 Pet. 1.11. and ch. 3.19. Rom. 15.4.</note> It was by the ſpirit of our great Prophet, that all the Prophets of old did ſpeak: Like ſtars they all borrowed their light from this Sun; they were irradiated and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt; and when a holy Prophet foretels, ſuch a thing ſhall be, we may as confidently build upon it, as if Chriſt himſelf had ſaid, I will have it ſo. For indeed it is the voice of Chriſt that ſpeaks in the old Teſtament, as well as in the new: And poſſibly this may be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord Chriſt has ſpoken ſo little in the Goſpel concerning ſome new Teſtament-ordinances (as the Lords day for one) namely, becauſe the Prophets had ſpoken ſo much before; and Chriſt would not take off his people from the ſtudy of the old Teſtament, upon which the authority of the new does ſo much depend. Me thinks, as to the controverſie of the Chriſtian Sabbath, this ſhould abundantly ſatisfie any ſober Chriſtian; that the day of Chriſts reſurrection was propheſied of by David and others, as a day which the Lord would make and inſtitute, and accordingly practiſed by the inſpired Apoſtles upon the firſt day of the week, and this practice perpetuated by the Church of Chriſt, the Catholick Church in all ages ſince for above ſixteen hundred years. What can be objected with any colour of reaſon againſt ſo clear a truth?</p>

Let it be ſeriouſly conſidered, in what other ſenſe can a day (made long before in reſpect of Creation) be ſtiled the day which the Lord hath made, than in reſpect to a divine inſtitution?

                  </gap> the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarens day</hi> (in a way of reproach) yet in Scripture-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is a day of greateſt renown, being the firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Creation, and the firſt in dignity by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours reſurrection. The firſt-fruits of time, and the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of dayes; and accordingly the only day in which our Lord became the<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note> firſt-fruits of them that ſlept, and the<note n="g" place="margin">Col. 1.18.</note> firſt born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To all theſe may be added what ſome have probably argued; that this firſt day of the week was our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers Birth-day, as well as his Reſurrection day, yea the day of his Aſcenſion into Heaven, as well as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Spirit; but this I leave to Mr. <hi>Aſpinwal</hi> to make good: Only thus much I dare aſſert, that the day of our Saviours reſurrection, the firſt day of the week is the fitteſt for the commemoration of his Nativitie, Paſſion, Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all other bleſſed tranſactions in the work of our Salvation. For the Reſurrection of Chriſt implyes all the reſt, but is not neceſſarily of them: And if the Lord Jeſus had not riſen from the dead; what benefit had we had, either by his birth, life, death or burial? or being dead and buryed, how had he aſcended, and the Spirit (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter) deſcended, unleſs he had firſt bin raiſed from the dead? Beſides his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion are comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 24.26. Eph. 4.8, 9, 10. See Dr. <hi>Twiſſe p.</hi> 117. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. 1 John 20.17.</note> in Scripture as one compleat motion. As his dying and continuing under the power of death for a time, were but one entire work of Redemption: For however after his reſurrection he ſtayed a ſew dayes here upon earth to confirm the faith of his followers, and ſettle the affairs of his Kingdom, yet he was no ſooner riſen but preſently he ſpeaks of his aſcending; and indeed his riſing was in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his aſcending partly, if not a part of it: It was the firſt ſtep of his triumphant paſſage into his kingdom and glory. So that in a right ſenſe very Lords day is our Chriſtmaſs-day, Eaſter-day, Aſcenſion-day, Whitſunday, and all; my meaning, that in a right celebration of our
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115959:91"/>Chriſtian Sabbath, we ſolemnize the memorial of all theſe bleſſed ingredients in the work of our Redemption. We need not contend for an annual Solemnization of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours birth-day, reſurrection-day, aſcenſion-day; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need we fear oblivion of theſe gracious and glorious myſteries, if the Lords day were duly obſerved. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better keep alive the memory of theſe mercies, than by keeping a day in commemoration of them once a week; and no day ſo fit as the Lords day, in which we have the ſum of all: A day that brought forth the greateſt good to faln man of any day, even a compleat Redeemer; who on this day redeemed us with triumph from the tyranny of Satan, the dominion of death and hell; and<note n="k" place="margin">John 10.25. ch. 14. 19.</note> reſtored us to life and Salvation, yea, aſſured it unto us. Therefore I conclude with that renowned father; the Lords day was declared by the Lords Reſurrection to be the Chriſtians day;<note place="margin">Dies Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Chriſti re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectione de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratus eſt, &amp; ex illo caepit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere feſtivita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſuam. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Ep. 119.</hi> ad <hi>Jan.</hi> item de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate <hi>Dei. lib. 22.</hi> cap. <hi>ult.</hi> &amp; <hi>Serm. 15.</hi> de <hi>verb.

                  </note> and from that very time it began to be celebrated as the Chriſtian mans Feſtival: or rather with that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made.</hi> 'Tis no day of mans making, if the God of truth may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved. 'Tis a plant of the Lords own planting, therefore the Divel and all his inſtruments ſhall never be able to pluck it up. Neither can all the men, nor all the Churches in the world alter it to another day. And how remarkable is it that the Church for ſixteen hundred years ſhould no where offer or attempt to alter it, but in all places, and all ages obſerve it? What does this ſpeak, but the Divine authority of it, by which mens Spirits have been awed, and their hands tied from ſuch preſumptuous undertakings; the truth is (as I noted before) <hi>'tis built upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) <hi>being the chief corner-stone.</hi> And becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ever fall out in this world comparable to Chriſts Reſurrection in glory and power, therefore no day can be ſet up like unto this, neither can it be changed for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Bownd</hi> lib. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note> No man can tranſlate the work, therefore no man can tranſlate the day: The like cauſe can never be offered
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115959:91"/>to change this day which at firſt occaſioned the choice of it. Therefore it muſt and ſhall remain, till the end of all things; men do but kick againſt the pricks in oppoſing the Lords day; they that would raze out the remembrance of this day, muſt firſt pick out Chriſts mark which he ha's wrought into it by the work of Redemption, and ſo blot out the teſtimony of all the four Evangeliſts concerning Chriſts Reſurrection the firſt day of the week, together with the prophecy of the Pſalmiſt; which if they dare do, Yet</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have another conſpicuous mark to note it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other dayes in the week, namely our Saviours frequent apparitions on this day; after his Reſurrection from the dead. Here let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe glorious apparitions of our now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Redeemer, were no common favours, but choice and ſpeciall evidences of his owning providence, both as to perſons and times. For as he appeared not to all ſorts of perſons, but to ſome ſelect<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 10.41.</note> choſen witneſſes, who were either eminently devoted to his ſervice, or deſigned to teach others; ſo neither did he make his appearance to thoſe perſons every day, but principally and moſt uſually upon the day deſigned by the Prophets to his worſhip and ſervice, and now conſecrated by his bleſſed Reſurrection; moſtly vouchſafing his gracious viſits to holy men in holy time; ſuch (at leaſt) as were ſo, or ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although it be<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1.20.</note> ſaid, that he was ſeen of his Apoſtles fourty dayes between his Reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet it cannot be conſtrued thus,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Theophyl.</note> that he was ſeen every day during thoſe fourty dayes; but only thus, that there were ſo many dayes between his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, in which he was ſometimes ſeen. And this is all that the Greek will bear, for it is not <hi>[in fourty dayes]</hi> but <hi>[by four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes]</hi> that is, by the ſpace of fourty dayes at times; for ſometimes he diſappeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> However it may be ſuppoſed that our Saviour did appear on other dayes (as once he did upon a working
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115959:92"/>day) yet no other day of the week ha's the honour to be denominated, as the day of his appearing, but the firſt day of the week onely: 'Tis never ſaid, he appeared on the ſecond or third day, much leſs the laſt day of the week or the ſeventh day; but the firſt day of the week is expreſly and emphatically noted by name.<note n="*" place="margin">John 20.19. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Tis evident that our Lord appeared often on this day gracing it with his beatifical preſence above all dayes. In the<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 20.14, 15.16.</note> morning to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the reſt of the holy<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 28.9.</note> women, who, when they ſaw him, fell at his feet and worſhipped him; and in the evening of the ſame day to the eleven diſciples, and<note n="c" place="margin">Lu. 24.33.36.</note> them that were with them gathered together in a way of Church.<note n="d" place="margin">John 20.19. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this aſſembly convened it ſeemes by our Saviours own means, who appearing to <hi>Mary</hi> commanded her to carry tidings to his diſciples of his joyful Reſurrection. However a Chriſtian aſſembly it was, and the firſt that injoyed the preſence of Chriſt after his death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; then it followes,<note place="margin">John 20.26.</note> 
                  <hi>After eight dayes the diſciples were within again, and</hi> Thomas <hi>with them, then came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt [after eight dayes]</hi> that is, as ſome would have it, after the day-light of the eighth day was paſt, or as the <hi>Geneva</hi>-tranſlation reads it, <hi>eight dayes after;</hi> or, after eight dayes were come; that is on the eighth day: Which reckoning the Reſurrection-day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, was juſt that day ſeven-night, or the next firſt day of the week, there are ſix working-dayes in the week, and Sabbath and Sabbath make eight, now Chriſt appeared the firſt;<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>L'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange p.</hi> 73.</note> and the next ſucceeding, which was the eighth day ſo the antients generally expound it: It is neceſſary that this ſhould be the Lords day ſayes <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> made an oration on purpoſe for it, ſtiling it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the new Lords day, becauſe it was the firſt Lords day ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized in the weekly revolution after the Reſurrection-day. We ſhall clear it by Scripture, when we come to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115959:92"/>anſwer the Objections; mean while let it be noted, that this was the ſecond ſolemn apparition of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, after he roſe from the dead; for the next mentioned by this Evangeliſt is ſaid to be the third time that he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf; which what elſe can it ſignifie to us,<note place="margin">John 21.14.</note> but that he appeared not between thoſe two firſt dayes? not on the ſeventh day, nor on any of the other ſix; he was abſent all the week and appeared to none (except to ſome ſingle perſons as <hi>Peter</hi>) he made no publick apparitions at ſolemn aſſemblies but upon his own day.</p>
               <p>Now methinks ingenous Chriſtians ſhould thus reaſon within themſelves; certainly 'tis written for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Lord Jeſus roſe from the dead on this day, that in the morning of the day he ſhewed himſelf to the holy women; that the ſame day at evening [being the firſt day of the week] the diſciples were aſſembled, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came and ſtood in the midſt, and after eight dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>i.e.</hi> that day ſenven-night (for though part of the former and part of the latter day made it eight dayes, yet could it be but ſeven nights if we count it by nights, according to the account of natural dayes, ſuch as the dayes of the week are) ſurely theſe things are not written in vain; that our Saviour ſhould ſolemnly ſhew himſelf in a Chriſtian aſſembly on the very day of his Reſurrection, and that there was no other apparition till that day ſeven night; this no doubt was of purpoſed providence, to give original to that Ordinance of the Lords day which accordingly ha's been obſerved ever ſince. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it one Argument (in conjunction with others) of his Apoſtleſhip, that Chriſt had appeared to him.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.1. ch. 15. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Am not I an Apoſtle, have not I ſeen Chriſt Jeſus our Lord?</hi> And may not I in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation with other arguments (as prophetical prediction <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118. and Apoſtolical practice <hi>Acts</hi> 20. allege this as one proof of our Chriſtian Sabbath? That Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord was often ſeen upon it, ſeen in aſſemblies of his Saints, ſeen in his royal robes, in his ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and not only ſeen but heard, preaching peace
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115959:93"/>to poor ſinners; opening Scriptures, cheering, quickening warming cold, dead, ſad hearts; for when the diſciples ſaw him they were<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 24.32. John 20.21.</note> glad, and their hearts did burn within them, while he opened the Scriptures to them; and all this on the firſt day of the week. Tis true after this double apparition, our Saviour appeared on a working day, as the diſciples were a fiſhing, and that was the third time of ſhewing himſelf or the third day of his appearing.<note place="margin">John 21.3.14.</note> But what of this, The diſciples were ſufficiently confirmed in the authority and ſolemnity of the Lords day by the two former appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore well might Chriſt appear the third time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a working day and countenance worki-day-buſineſs by his preſence, to teach his diſciples and us that every day is not a Sabbath day. But this fiſhing-day is not named; it might as well be on the Jewes Sabbath as any other day of the week, for ought appeares to the contrary in the Text; yet I do not ſay, it was; I will not ſpeak, where the Scripture is ſilent.</p>
               <p>How often the firſt day of the week was celebrated by our Saviour between his Reſurrection and aſcenſion, is not punctually ſet down in Scripture. <hi>Junius</hi> is confident for every week. But there is good evidence for the two firſt, and none againſt the three laſt. Much may be ſaid for that famous apparition on a Mountaine in <hi>Galilee;</hi> which learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lightfoot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 28.16, 17, 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Fenner</hi> and others conclude without doubt to have been on the firſt day of the week.<note place="margin">Mar. 16.15, 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now the aſcenſion-day drawes on, and Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes his Corporal preſence from his diſciples, but on the day of Pentecoſt he viſits them again by his ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And that this alſo was on the firſt day of the week ſhall be fully clear'd, when we come to the fourth mark:</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> Some years after all theſe it pleaſed the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to appear again on this day: Namely, to his ſervant <hi>John</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> (little paradiſe we may call it; for the preſence of Chriſt makes a wilderneſs a paradiſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſo much of his preſence as this bleſſed Apoſtle now
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115959:93"/>enjoyed; more than ever was vouchſafed to any man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, ſince Chriſt went up to Heaven) <hi>I was in the ſpirit,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>upon the Lords day;</hi> what then? Why <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>I ſaw ſeven Golden Candle-ſticks;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>In the midſt of them one like the ſon of man;</hi> So like him that indeed it was the ſon of man, the man Chriſt Jeſus; on the Lords day then <hi>John</hi> ſaw Jeſus Chriſt in the midſt of his Churches, filling them with his bleſſed preſence, that day above all others; and holding the ſtars in his right hand; that is, holding forth Heavenly light, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word on that day eſpecially; this <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and this he is commanded to ſet down in writing <hi>verſe</hi> 19. and accordingly written it is, and written for our learning, upon whom the ends of the world are come. And what may we learn from it? Surely this at firſt view. <hi>viz.</hi> That in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time the Golden Churches of Chriſt were wont to meet, Goſpel-Miniſters to preach, and Chriſt himſelf to be preſent with them by his ſpirit on the Lords day. And this is written for a pattern to after-ages, and there is a<note n="*" place="margin">Verſe <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> bleſſing pronounced on thoſe that read and keep the things that are written in this book. Bleſſed be Chriſt for this bleſſed book; here we have another glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt on the Lords day (not to one man only, or one Church only, but ſeven Churches, in which no doubt there were more then ſeven thouſand ſoules) and that this Lords day was alſo the firſt day of the week none but peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſpirits ever queſtion'd. <hi>Ignatius</hi> who was trained up in the School of this great Apoſtle (and in all reaſon was moſt likely to know his terms)<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>ad</hi> Magneſ.</note> clearly makes it a weekly holy-day obſerved by Chriſtians in the room of the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Sabbath of the Jewes. Yea, the Lords day was never taken for other, than the firſt day of the week by any Chriſtian writer in any age, ſince the dayes of St. <hi>John</hi> till this laſt age of liberty and lyes, that ever I could ſee or learn. Fathers, Councils, Schoolmen, ancient, modern writers, (two or three of this generation excepted) do conſtantly underſtand it of Chriſts Reſurrection-day, the firſt day
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115959:94"/>of the week; and one would think the conſtant Dialect of the Church of Chriſt a ſufficient Dictionary to interpret a word or phraſe in Scripture, eſpecially in ſuch a ſenſe as does not croſs but correſpond with Scripture. So does this, for how agreeable to Scripture is it to take the Lords day for that day which the Lord hath made? Beſides 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that this ſame beloved diſciple, who was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in penning the firſt apparition <hi>John</hi> 20. is a ſpectator of the laſt <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. and juſt as he had related, that he ſees this; the circumſtances are remarkable. <hi>John</hi> 26.19, 26. Chriſt appears in the midſt of the diſciples; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. in the midſt of the Candle-ſticks, or Churches; <hi>John</hi> 20.19. he appears upon the Reſurrection-day arguing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. repeating the ſame argument, Saying, <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and have the keyes of death and hell:</hi> To ſay no more, <hi>John</hi> 20. he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the firſt day of the week, and here again upon the day under a new name <hi>(the Lords day)</hi> becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his Reſurrection and former apparitions to be the day which the Lord had owned above other dayes, yea the day which the Lord had made and inſtituted. Thus we ſee how Chriſts often appearing on this day tends to the further marking out of the day. But this mark is ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhot at; objections come thick: but ſhort anſwers will ſerve, when nothing is objected, but what has been anſwered by others; or nothing to any purpoſe.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>I beleeve it will be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inquiry that Chriſt never appeared to any aſſembly, no not any one firſt day; for it is most certain, that the day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture-account begins with the evening. Now upon the Reſurrection-day we find Chriſt at the village ſeven miles from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>when it was towards evening and the day far ſpent</hi> Luke 24.29, 30. <hi>after which he ſupped with the two, which took up ſome time, then they returned that ſeven miles and a half to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>on foot; ſo that by that time they came there, the day must be quite ſpent; and though tis ſaid he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the firſt day at evening, yet the firſt day was then as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115959:94"/>fully ended as the Sabbath at ſun-ſet when they brought their ſick, which was forbidden on the Sabbath-day;</hi> Mark 1.32.</p>
               <p>Chriſt appeared in the morning of the Reſurrection-day as well as at evening; very early, as well as very late; <label type="milestone">

The inſtance of the diſciples, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from <hi>Emmaus</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that late, makes much againſt himſelf. For, as late as it was in the evening before they got home (the later the better, as to the caſe in hand) yet the Holy Ghoſt does not call it the ſecond, but the firſt day of the week. <hi>John</hi> 20.19. the ſame day at evening being the firſt day of the week, note it well: Firſt, The Evangeliſt calls this time of evening the ſame day in which Chriſt aroſe from the dead. Secondly, He calls it the firſt day of the week; by which two expreſſions he puts the matter out of all doubt, that this evening was a part of the firſt day of the week. Thus the Holy Ghoſt provides againſt future errors. Let the objector now bluſh to conſider, how ſhamefully he has given the lye to the ſpirit of truth 1. In affirming that Chriſt never appeared to any aſſembly, any one firſt day of the week. 2 That the firſt day was then fully ended, fully ended? then the Evangeliſt was much miſtaken to tells us it was the ſame day; he ſhould rather have ſaid the ſecond day, or the next day:] <hi>Mark</hi> 1.32. does (at moſt) but ſpeak the opinion and practice of the degenerate Jewes; who, if they ſtated the end of the Sabbath at the ſun-ſet evening by a traditional account (and therefore brought not their ſick to be healed till the Sun was down) yet their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115959:97"/>providence that ordered the Reſurrection of Chriſt to fall upon the firſt day of the week, did alſo take order for the ſending of the ſpirit on the ſame day. For that the day of Pentecoſt <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. was the firſt day of the week, as it is generally taken for granted by Chriſtian writers, ſo it may be evidently proved by the Scriptures. I ſhall not puzle the Reader with perplexing intricacies, nor lead men into labyrinths to find out the truth: Let plain Scripture determin the matter, look to the ſtatute-lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the feaſt of Pentecoſt <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.21, 22. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou work but on the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt both in earing-time and in barvest, and thou ſhalt obſerve the feaſt of weekes, of the firſt-fruits of Wheat-harveſt</hi> Levit. 23.10, 11, 12, 15, 16. <hi>When ye be come into the land which I give you, and ſhall reap the harveſt thereof, then ye ſhall bring a ſheaf of your firſt-fruits of your harveſt unto the Prieſt, and he ſhall wave it together with the offering of a lamb without blemiſh; on the morrow after the Sabbath he ſhall wave it; and ye ſhall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that yee brought the ſheaf, ſeven Sabbaths ſhall be complete even unto the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath ye ſhall number fifty dayes,</hi> So Numb. 28.26. and more fully Deut. 16.9. <hi>Seven weekes ſhalt thou number unto thee, begin to number the ſeven weeks from ſuch time as thou beginneſt to put the ſickle to the Corn.</hi> From the harmony of which four texts it appeares, that this feaſt had three ſignificant names which were all made good at that ſolemn Pentecoſt <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.</p>

(And the like he ſayes a little before concerning their Jubilee every fiftieth year) for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times ſeven, makes but fourty nine; to perfect the number therefore they borrowed the firſt day of the week and ſo conſecrated to God the firſt fruits of their dayes, as well as of their land.

               <p>The only material objection againſt this interpretation, is the judgment of Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> and the Engliſh Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours, who take the Sabbath <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. For the Paſſe-over-Sabbath; tis true, they do ſo; but herein they are

And cerainly a miſtake there is in this point. For that the morrow after the Sabbath could not be meant of the Paſſeover-Sabbath is clear; For</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be ſuch a morrow after the Sabbath as muſt never fall upon the weekly Sabbath; the reaſon is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the begining of their harveſt, when they put their ſickle to the corn, or harveſted their harveſt <hi>Le.</hi> 23.10. which they are expreſly forbidden to do upon their weekly Sabbath. <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.21, 22. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, but on the ſeventh thouſhalt reſt both in earing-time and harveſt.</hi> And ſee how this is coupled with the feaſt of firſt-fruits in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame place, <hi>Thou ſhalt obſerve the feaſt of weekes,</hi> &amp;c.

For the Paſſe-over-Sabbath being fixed upon a certain day of the month <hi>viz.</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Niſan,</hi> when ever this 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Niſan</hi> fell upon the Friday, the morrow after it muſt needs be on the Saturday, and ſo they muſt begin to reap their harveſt upon the weekly Sabbath againſt an expreſſe command of God. The Hebrew Doctors foreſaw this inconvenience, and had no other way to ſalve it, but by affirming,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in Levit. 23.</note> that this reaping did drive away the Sabbath, and that it was lawfull on the Sabbath-day: A moſt impious opinion. For it croſſes the very letter of Gods Law; <hi>In earing-time and in harveſt thou ſhalt reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The morrow after the Sabbath at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their account, muſt be ſuch a morrow as concludes it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.15, 16. therefore it could not be the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115959:99"/>of the Paſſeover-Sabbath, or any Feſtival-Sabbath; for there was no ſuch Sabbath at the end of the account, whatever there was at the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Paſſeover-Sabbath was fixed to a certain day of the month,<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 28.17.</note> namely the fifteenth day of the firſt month; and thus all their other Feſtivals, they had their fixed dayes. But this feaſt of Pentecoſt is no where affixed in all the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> to any one certain day of the month (nor indeed could it be, unleſs God ſhould make a ceremonial Law to croſs the Law of nature, or rather to limit the courſe of divine Providence, to ripen their corn juſt againſt ſuch a day of the month) which (as Dr <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> obſerves) is a very great preſumption that the Feaſt of Pentecoſt was a moveable Feaſt, (namely as to the day of the month) but immoveable as to the day of the week; ſo varying that it might always fall upon the day immediately following the ordinary Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Anti-type is the beſt key to unlock the type. And this is clear in the new Teſtament; for that Chriſt was our firſt-fruits in reference to his Reſurrection, St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. and that he roſe from the dead on the morrow after the weekly Sabbath, all the 4 Evangeliſts do inform us. And <hi>T. T.</hi> ha's granted us, that theſe things muſt be punctually fulfilled by Chriſt, as well in the time as in the type. From his own grant therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; That the day of firſt-fruits was the firſt day of the week, therefore ſo was the day of Pentecoſt, to the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour of that Lords day and the glory of God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt who ſanctifyed it by his preſence and power; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a new ſupply of tongues from Heaven (as if all the tongues upon earth were not ſufficient) to ſound forth the praiſes of our Redeemer, and ſpread his Goſpel all the world over upon the firſt day of the week, as an earneſt whereof there was a glorious beginning made this day, the Goſpel being now publiſhed to ſome of all nations; for there was now a great concourſe, even of every nation under Heaven, met at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 2.5. and at this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115959:100"/>meeting three thouſand ſoules converted, and baptized <hi>v.</hi> 41. a double baptiſm was indeed diſpenſed this day, the Apoſtles were now baptized with fire, and three thouſand converts with water. Which was ſuch a ſolemnity as the Church of God never ſaw the like from that day to this.</p>
               <p>I need ſay no more,<note place="margin">T. T. p. <hi>81.</hi>
                  </note> the adverſary confeſſes <hi>that this was the moſt glorious Sabbath that ever Church enjoyed.</hi> Only he would fain perſwade himſelf and others that it was the Saturday-Sabbath; but herein he befooles himſelf, and deceives others. His Grammar, Logick, and Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick never falled him more than in this point. See what a Grammarian he is! Mr. <hi>Aſpinwal</hi> had objected that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] tranſlated <hi>[fully come]</hi> ſhould rather be rendred <hi>[fully paſt]</hi> to which <hi>T. T.</hi> learnedly replies, <hi>that the Greek</hi> (<hi>being a</hi> Gerund in do) <hi>ſignifies</hi> [fulfilling] now I confeſſe tis the firſt time that ever I heard of a Greek Gerund in do; it may be this author learnt ſome Latin-Greek-Grammar, while he was a Roman-Catholick. I wiſh he do not ſtick too much in the <hi>Gerund in do</hi> ſtil. One paſſage in his book renders it a little ſuſpicious, as <hi>p.</hi> 146 <hi>[Let us,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>celebrate the ſeventh-day-Sabbath, a day of delights to the Lord, and ſo obtain meercy for the Sabbath-pollution of our dayes of ignorance]</hi> What does he hope to obtain mercy by doing? Nay, then I do not much wonder at his zeal for the Saturday-Sabbath, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder he does not cry up the old Covenant again. To trace him yet further; he is a little out in his Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick too. For in beginning the count of the fifty dayes on a Saturday he begins at the wrong end, making the laſt day of the week to be the firſt of the week, the ſeventh day the eighth day, the firſt day the ſecond day, the ſixth day the laſt day againſt his own profeſſed principles; and is not here ſtrange confuſion? Let me ask him in good earneſt if the ſeventh day were the firſt day in all thoſe ſeven weeks, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. how was the fourth Commandment kept all that while, which according to his opinion, will brook
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115959:100"/>no other weekly Sabbath but the laſt of the week? Thus for his Arithmetick. Now for his Logick: But here he is quite loſt; his Concluſions are flat Contradictions, and his his beſt Arguments Barbarous abſurdities: I do him no wrong, let the Reader judge.</p>

                  </label> he ſtates the Crucifixion of Chriſt on the morrow of the Paſſeover-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and yet he had argued before. That Chriſt was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed on the Paſſeover-Sabbath it ſelf; upon the day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Good Friday,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>was our Firſt-fruits waved by the Prieſts upon the Croſs:</hi> And what day that was, he tell us, namely, <hi>The fifteenth of Niſan, which was the firſt day of the Paſſeover-Feast,</hi> ſay his Learned Authors. <hi>And I affirm with them,</hi> ſayes the Objector, <hi>That this was the Sabbath,</hi> Lev. 23. So that to make good his croſs conceits, he would have Chriſt Crucifyed two dayes together, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on the Paſſeover Sabbath, and the morrow after it, that is, Friday and Saturday; which exceeds the cruelty of the crucifying Prieſts themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ſalve this ſore the coyns another conceit, namely, that the Paſſeover-day, and the Paſſeover-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath were all one:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 83.84</note> For thus he argues in his firſt book <hi>[The Iſraelites were appointed to bring (on the morrow after their Paſſeover-Sabbath) a Sheaf of their Firſt-fruits to be waved by the Prieſts before the Lord, and from that day to count ſeven weeks: And here let the believer (who ſees all Types ended in Chriſt) with confidence behold his dying Redeemer, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115959:101"/>Sheaf of Firſt-fruits waved upon the Croſs by the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying Prieſts the very morrow after he had eaten the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.]</hi> As if the morrow after the Paſſeover-Sabbath were all one with the morrow after the Paſſeover. Whereas the Learned Authors, whom he cites, will tell him, That the Paſſeover-day was no Sabbath, but a half-holiday, <hi>Ainſw. Lev.</hi> 23.5. But here again he is at odds with himſelf, for in his laſt book he boaſts of his concurrence with the moſt Learned of this Age, ſaying, <q>I affirm with them, That the Sabbath (<hi>Lev.</hi> 23.) is not the weekly Sabbath, but the firſt day of the Paſſeover-feaſt, that is the fifteenth day, as they affirm; therefore it could not be the fourteenth day.</q> And if he wikll contradict himſelf, who can help it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another groſs Error is this, That he makes Chriſt the Anti-type of the Firſt-fruits in reference to his Death, and quotes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. to prove it; which ſpeaks expreſſely of his Reſurrection. What ſhameful abuſe of Scripture is this?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The morrow after the Sabbath on which the account began, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> is known by three things, Firſt, by the Sickles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Corn, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16 9. Secondly, by the waving of the First-fruits, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.11. Thirdly, by offering the ſame day a Lamb without Spot, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.12. Now all theſe were punctually fulfilled in Chriſt on the day caleld Good Friday: Then the Sickle was put to him to cut him down, then he was Waved on the Croſ, then this Lamb without ſpot was offered; from which day the holy Sabbath is the firſt of the account, and at the end of ſeven full weeks the ſame day that began did end the account.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All this may be anſwered in a word. The Type and the time (to uſe his own language) hold no proportion. For the Sickle muſt be put to the Corn, the Firſt-fruits Waved, and the Lamb offered the morrow after the Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.10.12. Whereas Chriſt ſuffered and dyed the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath, and not upon that day which he counts the morrow after the paſſeover-Sabbath (for then he muſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115959:101"/>have been Crucifyed upon the Saturday) but upon that which he calls the Paſſeover-Sabbath it ſelf, namely, the fifteenth day of the Moneth. And here let him ſee how he hath loſt his Cauſe, and his Credit too: For, I hope, he will ſtand to the judgment of Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and the Engliſh Annotators (elſe why does he cite them;) now they both affirm, That the Paſſeover Sabbath muſt be the fifteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> and the morrow after it (from which they began to reckon) muſt needs be the ſixteenth day. From which they reckoned Excluſively (from the night of the ſixteenth day, ſayes Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> Law. 23.15) Now Chriſt ſuffered upon the Friday, which was the fifteenth day, and the ſuppoſed Paſſeover-Sabbath. The next day (being the Sabbath) was the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> from which day (namely when the day was ended) they muſt begin to reckon the fifty dayes to Pentecoſt, and ſo it falls pat upon the firſt day of the week; and thus <hi>T. T.</hi> reckons in his firſt book, excluding the morrow after the Paſſeover-Sabbath from being one of the fifty dayes. And ſo againſt his will he muſt be forced to begin upon the firſt day of the week, and that day that begins the account muſt needs end it; and ſo his confidence is utterly diſmounted. Indeed in his laſt book he begins to reckon the ſixteenth day Incluſively; but in the very next page he contradicts himſelf again, (leaving out the morrow after the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Sabbath as none of the number) a juſt jugment of God to make men fight with themſelves, when they would fight againſt his Truth.</p>
               <p>The Waving of the Firſt-fruits, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and putting the Sickle into the Corn, are Erroneouſly and falſely applied to the death of Chriſt; they do both more properly relate to his Reſurrection. The Reſurrection of the Juſt at the laſt day is reſembled to reaping, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.39. <hi>The Harveſt is the end of the world, and the Reapers are the Angels.</hi> Now Chriſt by virtue of his Reſurrection was the Firſt-fruits of that harveſt, <hi>The Firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The waving of the Firſt-fruits under the Law
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115959:102"/>did Typifie Chriſts riſing from the dead, and preſenting himſelf alive before God upon the day of his Reſurrection. Again, the offering of the Lamb without Blemiſh, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.12. makes not that day a Type of our Saviours dying day; for it was their daily offering, and upon the laſt of the fifty dayes they were to offer ſeven Lambs without blemiſh, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.20. Yet <hi>Chriſt dyed but once, and by that one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> Heb 9.28. ch. 10 14.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Jemiſon</hi> has prevented me in this Argument, and to give him his due he has done worthily in it, as to the ſubſtance of what he hath written. To conclude, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all attempts to the contrary, the glory of the Spirit's Miſſion reſts upon the Firſt day of the week: This day the Church of Chriſt was viſited from on high, the promiſe of the Father was ſent, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. The bleſſed Spirit came, the Diſciples were aſſembled, <hi>Peter</hi> preached, thouſands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and Baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and all this is written for our inſtruction. Why the Church aſſembled (as Mr. <hi>Sprint</hi> argues) why on that day? Why the holy Ghoſt? Why Preaching? Why Converſion, and adminiſtration of Sacraments? Why the Promiſe of Chriſt accompliſhed, all on this day? but ſtill to declare the will and Ordinance of Chriſt in bleſſing and ſanctifying this day to his Church; and ſo marking it out for a day of publick ſolemn worſhip, as a day in all its Prerogatives ſuperlative above other dayes, the day of our Saviours Reſurrection, by which we are Juſtified; the day of the holy Spirits Deſcenſion, by whom we are Sanctified.</p>

The Greek word is uſed but twice in all the new Teſtament, only theſe two have the honour to be matcht in this glorious appellation; and we muſt interpret the one by the other, therefore, if the Lords Supper be a Goſpel-ordinance and inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo is the Lords day; This paralel will pinch the adverſary, he cannot ſo much as pretend that the ſeventh day, (nor indeed any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day but the firſt of the week) was inſtituted by Chriſt, ſo as to be equalized in phraſe with that pure Evangelicall ordinance the Lords Supper. There is a vulgar objection abroad, that every day is the Lords day; therefore this Text makes as much for an every-day-Sabbath as the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lords day Sabbath. But the anſwer is eaſie, they may as well ſay every Table is the Lords table, and every Supper the Lords Supper, and ſo turn levellers of dayes and duties together. Well, we have brought it to this iſſue, that there is a day, a ſpeciall day under Goſpel (but not Jewes ſeventh day) which the Lord Jeſs ha's inſtituted and owned above all dayes by ſtamping his own moſt bleſſed name upon it, (as upon his ſacred Supper) and this we are ſure can be no other than the firſt day of the week.</p>

                  </note> Synecdochically, the part for the whole; there is no more reaſon to exclude prayer, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinging of Pſalms, becauſe theſe are not mentioned, than to exclude drinking of wine in the Sacrament (as the blind Papiſts do) becauſe neither is that expreſſed, but breaking of bread only. So that the firſt day of the week in effect is called the day of meeting to break bread, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accompanied with prayer, preaching and other holy exerciſes. Now (as the fore-mentioned<note n="*" place="margin">Theſ. 35.</note> Author obſerves) if ever the Saints uſed to break bread on any other day, yet the day is never mentioned as a ſpeciall time for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; nor do we find in all the Scriptures a day diſtinctly mentioned for holy duties (as this firſt day of the week is) wherein a whole Church meet together for ſuch ends, but that day was holy: The nameing of the particular day for ſuch ends, implies the holineſs of it. Well, the Saints at <hi>Troas</hi> meet on this day to receive the Sacrament.</p>

Why elſe does the Holy Ghoſt ſtory this down ſo exactly and preciſely? Is it not written for our learning upon whom the ends of the world are come? Yea doubtleſſe for our learning; that we might forecaſt our journeyes and other affairs in ſuch ſort, as to keep holy the Lords day, and not intrench upon it by travelling or the like; thus we have plain Apoſtolicall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for the obſervation of this day.

For 'tis ſaid, <hi>That through the Holy Ghoſt Chriſt gave Commandments to his Apoſtles whom he had choſen;</hi> That is, he gave them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments by inſpiring, and breathing the Holy Ghoſt upon them; which was upon the day of his Reſurrection.

If it be ſaid, that the Lords day is not there expreſſed; I anſwer, no more are any other of thoſe particulars appertaining to the kingdom of God which he ſpake,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sab. p. 134.</note> therefore it cannot be excluded, till it can be proved, that the keeping of this day to the honour of Chriſt is none of the things which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the kingdom of God.</p>

               <p>The remainders of the Objection about community of goods and Love-Feaſts are meer impertinencies, to plead for theſe in the peace &amp; ſettlement of the Church, is to put a plea in the mouths of Levellers, Libertines and Epicures.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115959:112"/>as men uſe to make when they meet at a Feaſt, and it ſuites well with the next Particular.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He concludes it was a Sabbath day or day of reſt from labor and worki-day buſineſs. And to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion this is clearly imployed in the Text. For upon this day the Apoſtle would have them contribute to the poor members of Chriſt as God had proſpered them; to wit, in the ſix foregoing work-dayes which argues a recollection and thankfull calling to mind the bleſſing of God upon their week-day labours, and what can be more Sabbath like? Beſides the Greek word is emphatical, <hi>[as God hath proſpered]</hi> ſo we read it, but it may be rendred thus, <hi>[as God hath given a good journey]</hi> or <hi>[a good voyage]</hi> plainly intimating that upon every firſt day of the week they had reſt and reſpit from their worldly imployments,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He counts the firſt day of the week their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament-day; as indeed it was; and the collection here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, ſpeaks as much: And doubtleſs this was a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full argument to prompt them to liberality: It were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ingratitude to ſpare a penny from the poor, when a man conſiders that God hath not ſpared the precious blood of his Son. Beſides all this, the firſt day of the week was the day of their ſolemn aſſemblies, for prayer, preaching propheſying, ſinging of Pſalms and other religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; all which were as fire to kindle their compaſſions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their diſtreſſed brethren; every word of God, every Sermon, every prayer, every Pſalm that was ſung might add ſome fuel to that Heavenly flame of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and Charity; and for theſe cauſes the Apoſtle choſe that time as the moſt ſelect and choice opportunity
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115959:113"/>to put them upon the practice of that duty. But here we are way-laid with Objections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any can diſcern the Sts. aſſembling</hi> (1 Cor. 16.) <hi>it muſt be by ſome other light than Gods word.</hi>

                  </label> and then if he have but eyes, here is light enough. For let him look upon the words once again. What does <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribe here? Collections or contibutions to the poor Saints. But who muſt contribute? every one. how muſt they contribute? by way of caſting into the common treaſury; ſo much the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>] implies <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and why ſo? That there might be no gatherings, when <hi>Paul</hi> came. Which there muſt needs have been, if every man had kept his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution at home in his own Coffer. So that it muſt be both a general and a publick contribution. Therefore it muſt be in a publick congregation. And why all this upon the firſt day of the week? Why not upon ſome other day but to mark out this day above others for the weekly ſeaſon of ſolemn aſſemblies, as alſo to move them by the day to the duty, What need there any mention of the firſt day of the week, if they had not held their meetings on that day, and if there had not been ſome ſpecial argument in the day to perſwade them to the duty?</p>
               <p>Paul <hi>does not enjoin them to lay it before the Deacons,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſurvey the Apoſtle exhorts every man to take of his own eſtate that he might give thereafter,</hi>

                  <hi>does notably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the conceit of a firſt-day-Sabbath, for he orders e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to lay by in ſtore as God hath proſpered him; that is according as his yearly revenue increaſeth or his weekly trade proves more or leſſe gainful. If the first day had been a Sabbath, the Apoſtle (knowing the proneneſs of our nature to mind earthly things) would never have put them upon the conſideration of their outward eſtates,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the firſt day of the week is a Sabbath, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>1</label> or day of reſt, is no conceit, but a Scripture-truth; as it ſhall ere long appear to the ſhame of ſuch reviling adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That upon this day they muſt take a ſurvey of their eſtates, becauſe they muſt give according to their eſtates and incomes, is a conceit indeed; there is no colour of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115959:114"/>conſequence in it; for I hope they might take their ſurvey on the Saturday night; no neceſſity of deferring it to the Lords day. Suppoſe a Miniſter of Chriſt ſhould urge this Apoſtolical ordinance ſtill (as I am informed Mr. <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> did) preſſing his people to contribute and lay up ſomething in a common ſtock every firſt day of the week for the releif of the poore; and that according as God ſhould bleſſe and proſper them in their callings the week before? Does it follow that therefore when the people are aſſembled together on the Lords day they muſt make the Church their Counting-houſe, or (before they come there) turn over their ſhop-bookes in ſtead of their Bibles? What a ridiculous inference were this? Good hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ands (I ſhould think) would end the week and their work together; good Chriſtians (to be ſure) will do ſo and not make the Lords day their counting-day, a recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-day indeed they may and muſt make it; to recount the bleſſings of providence in a way of praiſe and thankfulneſs and this is a Sabbath-day duty, as appeares by that<note n="*" place="margin">Pſalm 92.</note> Pſalm for the Sabbath. But further, to daſh this dream of the adverſary, let him conſider that (in effect) as much is<note n="*" place="margin">Ez. 46.5, 6.</note> ſaid of the Sabbath in the old Teſtament, as (here) of the Lords day; and it may be tis meant of the Lords day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>Tis further objected, <hi>That</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtle was read in theſe Churches on the Sabbath-day, Saturday he means, and then the Apoſtle exhorted them to Charity, and would have it to be their firſt work the next day while the ſweet ſenſe of the Epiſtle was upon their Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p>This is frivolous; For <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. The Apoſtle had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemned the Saturday-Sabbath among the reſt of thoſe legal dayes; and that he ſhould build again the things he had deſtroyed, we are not ſo much as to ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>Now take the ſum of all: On the firſt day of the week our Saviour was raiſed from the dead; on this day he often appeared after his reſurrection; ſent his holy Spirit on this day after his aſcenſion, and ſtampt his own bleſſed name
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115959:114"/>upon it; on this day the Saints aſſembled, the Apoſtles preached, the Sacraments were adminiſtred, Charities Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and concerning this day the Holy Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed; what day was ever markt out with more ſhining and illuſtrious Characters?</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115959:124"/>things, as learned Dr. <hi>Young</hi> ha's obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Saturday-Sabbath was never the day of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſemblies in all Churches; for the conſtom of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſemblies on that day never obtained in the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Sozomon</hi> teſtifies.<note place="margin">lib. 7. c. 19.</note> Whereas all Churches had their Church-meetings on the Lords day, not one excepted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Saturday or old Sabbath was never kept as a ſolemn Feſtival; for in many Churches it was a weekly Faſting-day, and once a year in all Churches namely Eaſter-Eve,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſtit.</hi> lib. 7. c. 24. and lib. 5. c. 15.</note> being the day of Chriſts greateſt abaſement, while he lay in the grave, and under the ſorrowes of death; whereas every Lords day throughout the year was held a ſolemn Feſtival, <hi>Conſtit. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All Ordinances were never adminiſtred with that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity on the old Sabbath as on the Lords day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ep. 118. <hi>Socrates</hi> lib 5. c. 22.</note> as the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, which in the pureſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was appropriate to the Lords day, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the day of bread, as we noted before.<note place="margin">Athan. Apol. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Hence that memorable paſſage of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for Breaking a Communion-cup clears himſelf thus, That time inſtanced by his accuſers was no Communion-time, for it was not the Lords day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their conventions on the old Sabbath were ever ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, not urged as of neceſſity; unleſs by <hi>Ebion</hi> and his followers, who were therefore condemned, as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. But the obſervation of the Lords day was ever held a Chriſtian duty; and never were any ſtigmatized with that black brand of Hereſie for obſerving of it; nay, it was the badge of Chriſtianity, I am a Chriſtian, I dare not intermit it, to all theſe I may add.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The old Sabbath was never the Chriſtian Sabbath or day of reſt, but a working-day. So in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 314.</note> he counſelled Chriſtians to work upon it, and the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> made a decree to this purpoſe, That Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought not to Judaize and to reſt from work on the Sabbath-day, but to prefer the Lords day before it, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115959:125"/>to reſt thereon from labour. In which words as Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> well obſerves, this Synod did but expound the ſentence of of holy <hi>Ignatius.</hi> I might inſtance alſo the Council at <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris, Carthage, Arragon, Maſcon, Chalons</hi> and other both Fathers, Councills and Chriſtian Emperours; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have prevented me in this kind of Antiquity. So much for the fourth Poſition.</p>

                  <hi>POSITION V.</hi> That the Lords day or firſt day of the week (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Sunday) is the Chriſtian Sabbath, or day of holy reſt.</head>
               <p>THis does naturally reſult from the premiſes. For the day being changed, and yet the law concerning the Sabbath continued and eſtabliſhed, the new day muſt needs be a day of reſt, as it reſts on the authority and morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the fourth Commandment, and as it ſucceeds the old day in Sabbath-ſolemnity. Yet it is not ſo much the name as the thing that I contend for; For although I am fully convinced, that as our ſpirituall exerciſes are called Sacrifices, becauſe they ſucceed in the place of the Jewes Sacrifices, ſo, and much more ſignificantly, may our Lords day be termed Sabbath, becauſe it<note n="*" place="margin">Succeeds I mean not in a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny ceremonious reſpect, but in relation to the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the place of the Jewes Sabbath; yet I had rather inſiſt upon the thing than the name, becauſe the one being proved the other cannot well be denyed. No rational man will ſtick at nominal reſpect where there is a real right
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115959:125"/>to it. A name of reſt will be eaſily granted due to a day of reſt, now that the Lords day is without diſpute a day of reſt, appears thus.<note place="margin">Cum de re con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat propier quam vorba di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur, de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis non debore contendi, &amp;c. <hi>Auguſt. cont.

               <p>Firſt, As it is the day of our Redeemers reſt from his painful work of Redemption, his riſing from the dead was his reſting from his work. By his Reſurrection this day he entred into his reſt; for hereby (as was ſaid before) he entred into his glory; which will further appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring two texts together; <hi>viz. John</hi> 7.39. with <hi>John</hi> 20.22. The firſt tells us, <hi>That the ſpirit was not yet given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified;</hi> therefore when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was given ſurely then Chriſt was glorified. Now the other Text informs us, That upon the day of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection the Spirit was given, <hi>For he breathed on them and ſaid, Receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now therefore undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord of glory was crowned with glory; not that he entred into the place of reſt and glory upon the day of his Reſurrection, but into the ſtate of reſt and glory; the place is but accidental to the ſtate; that which I modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded to further inquiry, <hi>page</hi> 128. Namely, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt did not locally aſcend into Heaven on the very day of his Reſurrection;</hi> has been ſince concluded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the Negative by a Reverend Brother from that Text of Scripture, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9 12. <hi>by his own blood he entred once into the Holy place.</hi> Which ſeems to a gue ſtrongly, that our bleſſed High Prieſt entred once; and but once into Heaven.

               <p>Secondly, The Lords day is a day of Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for ſolemn weekly worſhip, therefore alſo a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reſt from civil and ſecular imployments. Since 'tis impoſſible for men to meet together about ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and at the ſame time to follow their worldly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. obſerved as Sabbaths; as the Feaſt of unleavened bread.<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 16.8.</note> 
                  <hi>On the ſeventh day ſhall be a ſolemn Aſſembly to the Lord thy God: thou ſahlt do not work therein.</hi> And as the ſeventh
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115959:126"/>or laſt, ſo alſo the firſt day of that Feaſt was to be a day of reſt, becauſe a day of Convocation; <hi>On the firſt day ſhall be a holy convocation, ye ſhall do no ſervile work therein, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 28.17, 18.</note> Now that firſt day of unleavened bread (being a memorial of their Redemption from <hi>Egypt</hi>) was typical of our Chriſtian Sabbath, as was noted before. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there being a moral equity in Gods argument, that a day of holy Worſhip and holy Convocations muſt be a day of reſt, it is as applicable to the Lords day as ever it was to any day, for we have abundantly proved, that this is a holy Convocation-day, and 'tis a good note that of Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.8. That the Hebrew word <hi>Gnat-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> which we tranſlate, ſolemn Aſſemblies, does alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie reſtraint from labour, whereby the Holy Ghoſt would teach us, that Holi days ſet apart for ſolemn aſſemblies muſt be days of holy reſt and reſtraint from work. Such is the Lords day to us Chriſtians, and no other day but that, a day of ſolemn Aſſembly it is, and has bin from the Apoſtles days till now, yea a day of ſolemn Worſhip, therfore a day of reſt or Sabbath day, yea a day of ſolemn weekly worſhip, therefore the undoubted Sabbath of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the ſtanding rule for a day of weekly worſhip, and but a day ordinarily; for the Commandment numbers out ſix days in the week for worldly buſineſs,<note place="margin">As when a man makes two Wils, the laſt does <hi>ipſo facto</hi> make void the firſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no expreſs clauſe to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the repeal or revocation.</note> and one for religious exerciſes, neither more nor leſſe. So that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there were no repeal of the laſt day of the week, yet the firſt day being inſtituted by Divine Authority, makes void the laſt, and takes poſſeſſion of its place by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Divine Precept it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, as the Miniſtry and the Sacraments appointed by Chriſt are uſed by virtue of the ſecond Commandment; ſo the day appointed by Chriſt muſt be obſerved by virtue of the fourth Commandment: becauſe this is the general ſcope both of the ſecond and fourth Commandment, that we muſt obſerve all the Inſtitutions of God from time to time.</p>
               <p>I might argue further from that prophetical ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.20. where he preſignifies to his
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115959:126"/>Diſciples, that there ſhould be a Sabbath in force long after his death, at ſuch time as the old ſeventh-day-Sabbath was either quite out of doors, or out of date at leaſt: therefore he ſpake of the Chriſtian Sabbath which we are obliged both by Law and Goſpel to obſerve.</p>
               <p>The Ancients indeed do ſeldom apply the title of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to the Lords day, yet ſometimes they do.<note place="margin">

Touching our Saviours travelling this day, I have anſwered before: That it was without labour (ſuch as is the motion of immortal and glorified bodies) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Preſident for us, who dwell in theſe corruptible houſes of clay: And I add moreover, That Chriſts walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Diſciples that day was no more an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the holy reſt of the firſt day, than the Fathers working every day to the Sabbatical reſt of the ſeventh day: 'Tis our Saviours own Argument, (in anſwer to a like objection) <hi>My Father worketh hitherto and I work:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 5.17.</note> That I termed this journey to <hi>Emmaus [a Sabbath-days journey]</hi> was in reference to the diſcourſe by the way, not the length of the way: To which upon ſecond thoughts I add this further anſwer, That 'tis very uncertain, whether Chriſt travelled all the way on foot to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and back again: The Scripture is ſilent, and therefore we may not ſpeak. The Objector indeed has it often up, That Chriſt travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fifteen miles on his Reſurrection-day: but he ſpeaks without Book, and can never prove it by Scripture, for he might overtake the two Diſciples near <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and how he came there we read not, neither can we tell how he conveyed himſelf back again to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Gueſſes and conjectures are no arguments.</p>

                  <hi>POSITION VI.</hi> That the Sabbath begins in the Morning.</head>
               <p>THis Poſition hath been alſo handled and proved abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by others, chiefly by Mr. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pynchon,</hi> whoſe Arguments I judge unanſwerable. 'Tis to me an unqueſtionable concluſion, That the Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a natural day conſiſting of 24 hours, it muſt begin and end as the natural day it ſelf does. Now in Scripture-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the natural day begins and ends at or about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, that it begins in the dark night, is evident from that fore-mentioned place, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35. Where we read of our Saviours riſing in the morning a great while before day; or while it was deep in the night. Hence alſo the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the natural day is reckoned from about noon or mid-day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.13. <hi>When the evening was come the Diſciples came to Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Scripture ſpeaks of two evenings. Exod. 30.8. Chap. 16.12.</note> about ſending away the multitude to ſeek their dinner in the Villages, and that this was not the ſun-ſet-evening is clear; for after the multitude had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and were diſmiſſed, we read of another evening, <hi>v.</hi> 23. ſo that the former evening (all circumſtances conſidered) muſt needs be about mid-day, therefore it muſt have a morning anſwerable to it, which muſt neceſſarily begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-night, when the<note n="a" place="margin">Jonah 4.7.</note> morning-Sun begins to aſcend; as it does from mid-night till mid-day, or<note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>perfect day,</hi> and then it declines again, and the<note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 6.4.</note> ſhadows begin to be ſtretched out (called the <hi>ſhadows of the evening</hi>) till they fall into the darkneſs of the night, which is deepeſt at mid-night.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:115959:128"/>
               <p>Againſt thoſe that begin the natural day, and ſo the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath at Sun-ſet evening, we may object this, (which they can never anſwer) That by their reckoning, Chriſt muſt riſe from the dead the ſecond, not the third day after his burial. For 'tis clear that he was not buried or incloſed in the heart of the earth, till after the ſun-ſet evening.<note place="margin">Matth. 27.57. Mark 15.42.</note> For <hi>Joſeph</hi> went not to <hi>Pilate</hi> to beg the body, till the even was come; namely, the later evening which begins at Sun-ſet, and after this, there were many things to be done before the bleſſed body of Chriſt was laid in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. As the<note n="(c)" place="margin">Mark 15.46.</note> buying of fine linnen to wrap it in, beſides the imbalming or perfuming it with<note n="d" place="margin">John 19.40.</note> ſpices and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, as the manner of the Jews was to bury. This (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other Funeral rites) took up ſome time, ſo that it muſt needs be after Sun-ſet before this ſad Funeral was finiſhed. Now if the Sabbath had begun with the Sun-ſet evening, Chriſts Reſurrection-day being the morrow after the Sabbath, could be but the ſecond day; whereas it is a great Article of our faith, grounded upon the<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.4.</note> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>That Chriſt roſe from the dead the third day,</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the type of <hi>Jonas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, however the Jews in later times begun their Sabbath at evening (as we grant they did) ſuperſtitiouſly reckoning their preparation-time part of their Sabbath-time, yet it is very conſiderable, that the Holy Ghoſt keeps a contrary account, ſtating the end of the Sabbath towards the dawning of the day following: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1. in the end of the Sabbath which dawned towards the firſt day of the week: Now if the Sabbath ended at the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the next day, then it muſt needs begin about the ſame time the day before, and as the old Sabbath began and ended in Gods account, ſo muſt the Lords day.</p>
               <p>In a word, how prepoſterous is it and incongruous both to Scripture and nature to begin the day at evening? how ill does this agree with thoſe Texts of Scripture, that make the morning the firſt part of the day, and evening the laſt? The Angels we know are called<note n="f" place="margin">Job 38.7.</note> 
                  <hi>morning ſtars,</hi> not <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115959:129"/>ſtart,</hi> becauſe they were created in the beginning of the Creation, and the days of the Goſpel are called<note n="g" place="margin">Zech. 14.7.</note> 
                  <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in the evening it ſhall be light)</hi> becauſe they are the laſt days; according to the common Dialect of Scripture,<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 5.3. Pſal. 143.8 Gen. 49.27.</note> 
                  <hi>morning time</hi> is firſt, evening laſt, and evening never ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies early but late, becauſe it is the later part of the day. But others have ſufficiently cleared this truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to add any more were but to light a candle to the Sun. A word or two in anſwer to the Objections, and we have done.</p>

                  <hi>POSITION VII.</hi> The Lords Day muſt be kept holy to the Lord.</head>
               <p>THe very appellation of it together with the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians is ſufficient proof of this. 'Tis a pious and ponderous ſpeech of a late worthy Writer,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cheynels</hi> Treatiſe of the Bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>p.</hi> 402.</note> 
                  <hi>The approved practiſe of the primitive Chriſtians declares the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the doctrine of the Apoſtles ſhews what was the command of Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath concerning the ſanctification of the firſt day of the week, which is therefore called the Lords day, and the Chriſtian Sabbath.</hi> If it be the Lords day (as we have proved) then let it be conſecrated to the Lord as holy and honourable,<note place="margin">Iſai. 58.13.</note> even to that Lord whoſe name it bears, to him, I ſay, who hath on his veſture and on his thigh a name written,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.16.</note> 
                  <hi>King of kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> even the Lord of glory, a Lord as far above the greateſt lords on earth, as they are above their meaneſt Subjects. 'Tis the Lords day and therefore the Lords due; let us render to Chriſt the things that are Chriſts: Why did the Lord make this day, but that all his faithful ſubjects and ſervants ſhould keep it, and keep it holy to him that made it? O let the law of the living God over-awe our Conſciences, which is ſtill in force for a day of weekly worſhip at his appointment, and ſuch we have proved the Lords day to be. More Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115959:130"/>might be produced, But thoſe already urged are ſufficient to ſecure this truth from the dread of that down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall threatned by the Adverſary. The Devil and his agents may puff at the Chriſtian Sabbath, but confident I am, they ſhall as ſoon blow out the Sun with a pair of bellows, as totally extinguiſh this Ordinance of Chriſt: the chief ground of my confidence is the Word of God, upon which it is founded; and next to that the writings of the antients, ſo many in ſeveral Countries, and ſeveral ages bearing witneſs as one man to this Chriſtian cauſe, with whom although I would be loth to err in any thing, yet do I the leſs miſtruſt my ſelf to err, while I keep them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and do with more confidence look an adverſary in the face, when my quiver is full of their Teſtimonies, as a late Author ſpeaks on another occaſion. To draw to a Concluſion, from Doctrinal Poſitions about the Chriſtian Sabbath, we ſhall deſcend to ſome practical Directions; I cannot ſtand to ſpeak fully and largely to the duties of the day, neither need I; other Treatiſes have done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as Mr. <hi>Sprints,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepheards,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gouges,</hi> but eſpecially Mr. <hi>Philip Goodwins;</hi> only for the help of thoſe that want thoſe excellent helps, I ſhall hint a few things, and commit all to the bleſſing of him whoſe day and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I have argued and contended for.</p>
               <p>Briefly, the practice of the Chriſtian-Sabbath ſtands chiefly in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> In preparation to it, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be ſolemn and ſerious preparation the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening before, to get our hearts into a Sabbath frame, this the Lord calls for in the very front of the Commandement, <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,</hi> remember it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes, that you may keep it holy when it comes; this word <hi>[Remember]</hi> ſhould be as a bell to toll us in from our Shops and Farms, to our Chambers and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, there to commune with our own hearts, to caſt up our ſpiritual accounts, to call over our wants, and (if we have hearts) to weep over our week day ſins, and ſtir up our
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115959:131"/>ſelves to take hold of Chriſt, that we may make peace with God, they that have any acquaintance with heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, find it hard to have to do with a duſty world, full of ſins and ſnares, and not be defiled or intangled with it; earthly things are apt to leave a tincture upon the moſt holy and heavenly hearts: There muſt therefore be a rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing off this ruſt of the world, a waſhing theſe dirty hearts and hands before we are fit to draw nigh to God in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip;<note place="margin">Exod. 19.14.</note> What were thoſe Ceremonial waſhings of old, but emblematical predictions and documents of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Goſpel-worſhip? and (if I miſtake not) ſomething to this purpoſe is propheſied concerning the pureſt times and Churches in theſe later days.<note place="margin">Rev. 15.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. We read of thoſe that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt and his Image, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that had ſhaken off the yoke of Anti-Chriſtian Tyranny and Superſtition, ſtanding upon a ſea of glaſs with the harps of God in their hands; thoſe harps in their hands ſpeak them in a poſture of publike worſhip. But what means their ſtanding upon a ſea of glaſs? Why among other things, I conceive, it alludes to that Laver or<note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 7.23.</note> ſea in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, in which the the Prieſts were wont to<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 4.6.</note> waſh when they went to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and it may teach us thus much, that the people of God under the Goſpel, as well as they under the Law, muſt waſh before they worſhip, there muſt be ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſanctification of the Sabbath follows, and this alſo conſiſts in two things. <hi>Holy reſt,</hi> and <hi>holy work.</hi> Firſt, we muſt keep it as a day of <hi>holy reſt</hi> to the Lord, reſting from our own works, our own words, and our own thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are bound upon the Lords day to reſt and ceaſe from our own works, whether works of labour, or works of pleaſure, if I may ſo diſtinguiſh. The Lords day muſt neither be our working-day, nor our play-day; both theſe are prohibited by the letter of the fourth Commandment, and the analogy of that Text which ſeems to be written
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115959:131"/>as a Commentary upon the Commandment, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.13, 14. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him; not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thy own words, &amp;c.</hi> In which words we have the lively Picture and Pourtraiture of a true Sabbath, in both parts of it; it muſt be celebrated with reſt from our own ways, works, words, pleaſures, and this reſt muſt be accompanied, with a ſpiritual rejoycing in God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Sabbath, ariſing from an honourable eſteem of the day, conſidering whoſe day it is, namely, the Lords. Now the ſcope of this Text is as applicable to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath as ever it was to the Jews Sabbath, ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt, a day of holy rejoycing in the Lord as well as theirs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.24. Secondly, a day which hath the Lord for its author as well as theirs. Thirdly, a day every whit as honourable as theirs, yea a degree above it, being inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted upon a more noble account, <hi>Viz.</hi> The moſt gracious and glorious work of Redemption. Fourthly, a day in all reſpects as holy as theirs, holy I mean, in reſpect of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and dedication to holy duties, as prayer, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, breaking of bread, praiſe and thankſgiving, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. and 20.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.27, 28. Therefore it muſt be kept with reſt from accuſtomed labour and pleaſure, as well as theirs, and that by vertue of the fourth Commandment, which requires the ſanctifying of one day in ſeven of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment as a Sabbath, with reſt from ſervile works, and ſecular imployments. And let it be further conſidered, both the fourth Commandement and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in commenting upon it, do firſt and chiefly call for <hi>ſanctity;</hi> Secondarily, for reſt: Firſt, <hi>Remember the Sabbath to ſanctifie it,</hi> then, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no work.</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is required as the end, ceſſation from labour as the means; the one as principal, the other as acceſſary. Now both Prophets and Apoſtles have markt out the Lords day as a holy day, to be ſpent in holy duties of ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115959:132"/>and that weekly; therefore by the Law of God and nature we are bound to keep it as a day of weekly reſt, otherwiſe we ſeparate the end from the means, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; reſt from ſervile work being an inſeparable adjunct to a day of ſolemn worſhip: What then ſhall we ſay to thoſe that afterwarning make the Lords day either a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon working-day, or a ſporting day? the former I may fitly call the Devils workmen, who will one day pay them their wages; the other the fleſh's Bondmen whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the end will prove torment without end. The Lord awaken both to repentance better then that of <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe ſin (of the two) is greater then his,<note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 12.16.</note> there are prophane <hi>Eſau's</hi> under the Goſpel, and they are the worſt of <hi>Eſau's;</hi> there is alſo a ſin called<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2.22.</note> Sacrilege condemned in the Goſpel, and Sabbath-breaking is very like it; when ſinners lay ſacrilegious hands upon that which is conſecrated to the Lord, for a ſin much like to which <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife were once ſtricken with ſudden death, and how many ſuch dreadful ſtrokes have been felt and heard in theſe later days? I ſhall not repeat what has been already committed to record by others. Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others have been ſerious obſervers of Gods heavy hand in this kind. I could ſay ſomething of what I have ſeen with my own eyes, and heard with my own ears. But I ſhall forbear,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.1, 2.</note> when men are ſtruck dead in the very act of their ſin, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> in touching the Ark, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> in offering ſtrange fire, when the ſin and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meet together, and do one point at the other, ſurely Gods hand is not to be ſlighted. Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> has related many ſuch tremendous ſtrokes upon thoſe that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to work on the Lords day, and ended their lives and their work together; having no more reſpit between their ſin and their execution [or expiration] then with trembling lips to tell others the ſecret reflections of their own guilty Conſciences, and how many Malefactors have we heard at their execution, bewailing their profanation of the Lords day, as the leading-cauſe of all their miſchiefs and miſeries?
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115959:132"/>Now the Conſcience of the ſinner ſmarting under Gods revengeful rod is many times like a finger to point out the ſin for which God ſmites, as we ſee in the caſe of<note n="a" place="margin">Judges 1.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibezek.</hi> To be ſhort, the exemplary judgments of God againſt this ſin of Sabbath-breaking, falling in ſo great variety, and happening ſo thick together in many places, do call aloud to the inhabitants of the earth to<note n="b" place="margin">Iſai. 26.9, 10.</note> learn righteouſneſs; and it is doubtleſs our duty with humble reverence, and holy awfulneſs of the divine Majeſty ſoberly to obſerve and improve them, inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Gods judiciary proceedings is a<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 28.5. and 10.4, 5. Iſai. 5.12.</note> ſin frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Scripture, and ſeverely threatned. Reader, if neither Scripture-Arguments, nor exemplary judgments will reclaim thee from violation of the Lords day, proceed on in thy prophaneneſs ſtill; it may be the Lord will make thee the next example, to teach others what thou wilt not learn thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>Something might alſo be added from Chriſtian experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 'tis obſervable, that when the Spirit comes effectually to convince of ſin, commonly one of the firſt ſins which the eye of inlightned Conſcience fixes upon, is the neglect of the Lords day, and (conviction ending in converſion) one of the firſt duties which the ſoul comes ſeriouſly to cloſe withal is the ſtrict obſerving of the Lords day, grace works much this way, and does exceedingly diſpoſe the heart to this duty; for which I dare appeal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of many thouſand living Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Add to this the ſpiritual profit and ſenſible growth of grace, with the ſweet comfort and final peace experienced this way. Tell me, where does true Religion thrive bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the power of godlineſs flouriſh and proſper more than in Families, Cities Countries and Kingdoms where the Lords day is duly obſerved? on the contrary, where does ſuperſtition, irreligion, Atheiſm and profaneneſs abound more than where this day is neglected and vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? 'tis a ſerious Obſervation of a learned<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hakewils</hi> diſcourſe of the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dignity, and end of the Lords day.</note> Author, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ingreſs and progreſs of Popery in former times:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115959:133"/>Namely, <hi>That after-ages much degenerating from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Primitive times, ſo infinitely multiplied and magnified their holy-days beyond all meaſure and reaſon, that the Lords day began to be ſlighted, and accounted with many a common Holy-day, perchance inferiour to ſome of their Saints days; which no doubt was a ſpecial occaſion of that thick cloud of Superſtition, which afterwards overſhadowed the face of the Church; and in appearance the reducing of this day to its original honour would prove the readieſt means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Church again to her original lustre and beauty even in thoſe places where that cloud is not yet diſpelled, &amp;c.</hi> But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In order to the ſanctifying of the Lords day, we muſt ceaſe not only from doing our own works, but from ſpeaking our own words. Good reaſon, for it is none of our own day, therefore let none ſay <hi>Our tongue is our own</hi> on this day. Chriſtian, if thou canſt not ſpeak religiouſly on the Lords day, learn to ſpeak ſparingly; rather be ſilent, then ſinful in thy ſpeeches. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reporteth of <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> that being in company with ſome who uſed ill language he was very mute; and being asked the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he replyed, <hi>It hath often repented me that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, never that I have held my peace.</hi> Thus much the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teaches us, <hi>That in the multitude of words there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſin therefore</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 17.27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>he that ſpareth his words is wiſe.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if a man ſpeak of heavenly things on the Lords holy day he may with <hi>Paul</hi> continue his diſcourſe till mid-night, and never ſpeak too much; but of earthly things we cannot ſpeak too little; Oh that our hearts and lips were more heavenly on the Lords day, that there might be more ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of grace and heaven in all our Sabbath-day diſcourſes! how much were it to be wiſhed that on this day Chriſtians would ſpeak leſs of what they ſaw, more of what they heard in the publike aſſemblies? Alas! ſhould the Lord put that Queſtion to many Chriſtians now, which once he did on this day to the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus; What manner of communication is this that ye have one with
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115959:133"/>another?</hi> how would it put ſome thouſands to the bluſh, who have nothing but earth, or froth in their mouths?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt alſo lay a charge upon our hearts not to think our own thoughts on the Lords day.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note> For the Law of God is ſpiritual, and bindeth the heart from thinking, as well as the tongue from ſpeaking, or the hand from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides what vile hypocriſie is it to lay a reſtraint upon our words and actions, when in the mean time we give ſcope and liberty to our thoughts to wander after a thouſand vanities? this is juſt like painted Sepulchres, fair without, but full of rottenneſs, and dead mens bones within. Further, our own vain and worldly thoughts are great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and obſtructions to the duties of the day,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.24.</note> like that plague of flies in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was ſo vexatious that they could neither work, nor eat, nor drink,<note place="margin">and 10.12.</note> but the Flies moleſted them. Such a plague is a worldly heart on the Lords day, a man can neither pray, nor hear, nor meditate, but earthly thoughts peſter and diſturb him; yea, like that plague of Locuſts that devoured all; earthly thoughts eat up all the pleaſant fruit of Sabbaths and Sermons;<note place="margin">Luke 8.14.</note> yea like thorns they choak the very ſeed of the Word and render it unprofitable: How highly does it concern us therefore on the Lords day eſpecially to look to our hearts? Now if ever <hi>Solomons</hi> counſel is ſeaſonable,<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence,</hi> Or, <hi>Cum omni cuſtodiâ,</hi> with all keeping, as ſome read it; ſet guards and double guards upon it, for as <hi>Bernard</hi> truly ſpeaks, <hi>Corde nihil fugacius,</hi> Nothing is more flitting then the heart of man; 'tis a <hi>wandring Dinah,</hi> we had need watch it warily, and check it ſpeedily when it begins to hanker-after the world: In a word, to cure evill and earthly thoughts on the Lords day, we ſhould do well to awe our hearts with the apprehenſion of Gods all-ſeeing eye: 'Tis obſervable that our Lord appeared to his ſervant <hi>John</hi> upon his own day in a heart-ſearching-ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1.14.</note> not only burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in jealouſie againſt ſin and ſinners, but bright and ſhining as the ſearcher of hearts and tryer of reins, by
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115959:134"/>which title he then alſo ſtiled himſelf.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.23.</note> Conſider Chriſtian that on the Lords day eſpecially thy heart lies under the view of that fiery flaming eye of Chriſt; therefore let thy thoughts be none but ſuch as that pure and piercing eye will approve, and if Chriſt as the ſearcher of hearts be not awful to thee, yet me thinks Chriſt as the <hi>judge of ſecrets</hi> ſhould. O let the terror of that laſt day work upon our hearts every Lords day, the ſeat of the Judge is fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by a <hi>cloud,</hi> not a throne of ſilver or gold, but a <hi>cloud:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 14.14.</note> Now as we know the clouds are ſtorehouſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſhowres, ſo alſo of ſtorms and tempeſts; and thus doubtleſs that day of the Lord will be as a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to ſome, ſo a ſtormy day of tempeſts and terrors to others; and a great part of the tempeſt of that day will fall upon the thoughts and hearts of men, for<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>God will bring every ſecret thing into judgement;</hi> we muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able not only for <hi>idle words,</hi> but <hi>vain thoughts.</hi> And thus much of the firſt thing, we muſt keep the Sabbath as a day of reſt, but we muſt not reſt in this reſt; we muſt not make it a Sabbath of idleneſs, but a Sabbath of holineſs; we muſt not ſo much ceaſe from working, as change our work; ſervile work for ſoul work, worldly imployments for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exerciſes: That is the next thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To our holy reſt we muſt join holy work, and this is either publike or private; ſomething indeed muſt be done in private before the publike, our cloſet-devotions and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, duties common to other dayes muſt not he omitted this day, but rather augmented; their Sacrifices under the Law were<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 28.9.</note> doubled upon the Sabbath-day, and obſerve it,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.7.</note> their firſt ſervice was the burning of Incenſe before the Lord.<note place="margin">Matth. 28.1. Mark 16.2. John 20.1.</note> Now prayer is our Incenſe, let this be our morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exerciſe in private. Seek the Lord, O my ſoul, ſeek him early, do as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did, ſhe was early up to ſeek him whom her ſoul loved; ſhe was laſt at the Croſs, and firſt at the Sepulchre, in the dawning, while it was yet dark, very early in the morning ſay the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts. Oh that our love to Chriſt could keep pace
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115959:134"/>with hers! Shall we love the world better than Chriſt? if we have a journey to go about worldly concernments we can ſet out betimes; oh that we were as wiſe for our ſouls, as we are for our bodies! let not ſleep (that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of time) beguile us of our golden hours in the morning in which we are freſheſt and fitteſt for converſe with God; let the ſluggard that ſleeps with the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams in his face remember that ſaying of <hi>Auſtin;</hi> If the Sun could ſpeak, how roundly might it ſalute thee with this reproof? <hi>I laboured more then thou yeſterday, and yet I am riſen before thee to day.</hi> But this is too low an Argument, behold the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> is riſen, and he roſe early this day, therefore let us not ſleep as do others, but ſay and ſing with the Church,<note n="f" place="margin">Iſai. 26.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115959:135"/>for what one truly ſpeaks of duties and actings of grace, <hi>[they are good duties and good graces, but bad Chriſts]</hi> the like may I ſay of Sabbaths never ſo well kept, <hi>they are good Sabbaths, but bad Saviours;</hi> let our reſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be only in Chriſt, and to ſuch as take him for their reſt, his <hi>work</hi> is but <hi>recreation,</hi> and ſo indeed we ſhould eſteem it in a ſpiritual ſenſe; not looking upon it as <hi>a ſowr task,</hi> or a <hi>rigid exaction,</hi> but calling the Sabbath a delight, we ſhould keep it accordingly, even the <hi>whole day,</hi> with <hi>the whole man,</hi> as a day of delights to the Lord, being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond fleſh and the world, and having our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven, as much as is poſſible for creatures cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fleſh.</p>
               <p>To come to a cloſure, There is a double duty to be performed in private on the Lords day, which I ſeriouſly adviſe Chriſtians to make Conſcience of; namely, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual duty of meditation, and the celeſtial duty of praiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how ſeaſonable it is on the Sabbath to meditate, not only on the Word, but the Works of God, appears from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. which is a Pſalm for the Sabbath-day: How does the Pſalmiſt there ſearch and dive into the wonderful works of God?

                  <hi>from earth to Heaven, from time to eternity; yea walk upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and enter into Heaven it ſelf, the Paradiſe of God: How manifold are thy works, O Lord, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all!</hi> Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God that we caſt our eyes upon this day ſhould be as a flower to feed our Meditations. I ſpeak of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory Meditation; or that which is occaſional; one ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſe whereof is to feed our graces by our ſenſes, and (as we are Chriſtians) to conduct us to Chriſt by the view of all creatures and actions; <hi>when we look upon the Sun, it bids us look up to Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs, every ſtar
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115959:136"/>may mind us of that ſtar of</hi> Jacob, <hi>that bright and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtar; if we look upon our houſes, Chriſt is the door; if upon our bodies, he is the head; if upon our clothes, he is the garment of ſalvation; if upon our friends and relations, he is our husband, our friend, our Lord, our Law-giver, our King; if we walk, he is the way; if we read, he is the word; if we eat and drink, he is our food; if we live, Chriſt is our life:</hi> that is, a holy heart may make this ſpiritual uſe of all earthly objects and occaſions to contemplate Chriſt in them; and if we improve not our ſenſes this way, 'tis all one as if we were <hi>blind,</hi> or <hi>brutiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides this, there is a more diſtinct, deliberate, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſet meditation required on the Lords day; and the work of Redemption being the occaſion of the day, how ſhould our hearts work upon this bleſſed ſubject! Come Chriſtian, call in thy thoughts from all worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and contemplate this rare contrivance of thy Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; ponder it deeply, get lively and ſtrong apprehenſions of it, that it may leave deep and laſting impreſſions upon thy ſoul; view over the ſeveral paſſages and tranſactions in this <hi>Maſter-piece</hi> of all Gods works; view it firſt in the platform, how gloriouſly was this laid, in the eternal projects and<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4.</note> purpoſes of Gods love! yea in that eternal promiſe paſt between the Father and the Son,<note n="b" place="margin">Titus 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>In hopes of eternal life which God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, promiſed before the world began.

                  <hi>fulneſs of time</hi> Chriſt comes; we could not come up to him, lo! he comes down to us, O ſee the King of glory ſtooping, bowing the Heavens to come down and dwell in a dungeon, to lodge amongſt priſoners, and pitch his tent in the rebels camp. Think O my ſoul, how did the holy Angels wonder to ſee the King of Heaven ſtepping down from his throne to ſit on his footſtool; yea putting off (to the view) the robes of a prince, to put on the livery of a<note n="e" place="margin">Phil. 2.7, 8.</note> ſervant, and that, after <hi>treaſon</hi> had been ſtampt upon it, taking our nature, I mean, after it had been up in arms againſt God; not that he took the ſin of our nature (he that could make our nature without ſin, could alſo, and did take it without ſin) but the ſhame of it he took, in that he took it, when it was under a <hi>cloud,</hi> under a <hi>blot</hi> before God and Angels. How does this expreſs the love of Chriſt, a heart full of love to loſt ſinners! <hi>q. d. poor ſoult I cannot keep from you, I love your very nature, and will joyn it to my ſelf, and ſo I may ſave you from ſin and wrath, I care not if I become one with you, and dwell in your very fleſh: My glory ſhall not hinder, I will rather veil it for a while, and take the form of a ſervant, and become of no reputation, than you ſhall periſh for ever.</hi> Again, how does this ſpeak the unſpeakable love of God;<note place="margin">See M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> looking to Jeſus, p. 342.</note> as one ſweetly obſerves, <hi>God did ſo love the very nature of his elect, that though for the preſent he had them not all with him in heaven, yet he muſt have their picture in his Son, to ſee them in, and love them in.</hi> O meditate much on this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrein of love till it melt thy heart and make it burn within thee!</p>
